"But everytime I get u close, I only wanna hide away"
Am I really alone? Am I the only one?
I know I'm meant to say no （I meant to say no）
That's what you promised me
But you ruined her in a year
You’re the lead
Why can't we live together?
None of this is for show
I've been through some injuries
Just one look boy to melt me down
Running in the field of color after drowning in the sea
She would pick me up from practice
Though shallow in my shoes
And your heels so high
You could be my habit
And I'm wasting away
See your man show in the hills
Spill a ocean of secrets and ya
Until he felt your touch
"and we're all alone, there's no one home"
Maybe someday I'll share your little distant cloud
Now the longer I get stronger
When you're locked in on someone else
My three sixty five days on the wall
"We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball"
What it truly means to be in love
That's the life I love the best
In a foreign see me goin
Wheels like tong to the winter lope.
Then you are out the door
"Everybody, allegation"
If you're not sleeping with me
Don't let it make you cry
"Can't read my, can't read my"
I would still be holding you like this
But I know that I can't get away
Take me over the walls below
Only place left for you and i
You’d already decided
H cause I'm happy when you're riding next to me
This was a team sport
Just another second
If it just won't sing for you
Brings me to a natural high
And now my hearts gone cold
But that's the thing I like about you.
You held me in your arms
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me
That’s just me putting it loosely
Sleeping without you
He dreams of all the battles won
"Meet my next girl, she on top of shit"
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
"Oh, shawty thought you knew me"
As long as I'm with you
I'm caving in
Cause love is born when hearts collide
You've gotta know what happens next
Two sides to every story
I want a new life (start over)
It's been four long years since I've seen your face your voice
Can I put all of my love in you and I?
Hurry now and don't be late 'cause we ain't got time to chat
"To do anything you don't wanna do,"
Why is it so different when we wake up?
"You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy"
Get me away from here
My one and only all my life
When Fillmore County gets cold
Now  this is the return of the space cowboy
these are our memories
But after all this damage I can't help it (help it)
Talking 'bout it's not my style
"Talkin' loud and sayin' somethin',"
Let go and say that you (want me want me)
"Do I have your atten-tion? (Hey, hey)"
Livin' pages of the past 
And you know all the jokes to his punchlines
On some distant moon I lie on my back
Draggin the mink
I wanna stay but I can’t help from walkin out
Heart is taking over
I long to see the sunlight in your hair
I never regret the waking hours as the birth shot forth 
"I'm purging the city, he Diddy"
Thru this new frame of mind
"Had beef carniceria,"
I could travel back in time and hear Al Green sing
I'm not leaving 'til I get you to show me
Something's not the same
Seven up and coke on the pavement
What's the cost of the devil wish (your own bliss)
What it really means to live life golden
"Done with the shoulda- coulda, doo-doo-doo-dadada"
I know your feeling
"It's wrong and I need you, oh I"
We're right where we're supposed to be
Dance around her feelings
A wet world aches for a beat of a drum oh oh
"Tell her, tell her what you're about"
Sail away on ships of wonder
It's all written down in your lifelines
"I need you right now, here in my arms (Yeah)"
But you never call
And you scream at me for parenting you wrong
As I go deep into the funnel of love
Been putting up with this for far too long
I'll be the thorn in your side
I could sing it all night long
"Shoot you straight, man that truth will do you plenty damage"
"no, don't you forget it,"
Tame the fire or suffer to live
"You are my treasure, yeah, you, you, you, you are"
And maybe I’m just not good enough at all to feel your love
Saying why were you creeping around late last night
I will always rule your night
I could hold
those sweet memories
That half of my heart won't do
I see your face and it keeps me going
So she get the bust down watchiana (Watchiana)
She must be right for me
We’ve got to sort this out
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
"So good, this feel"
a nicer place to cash your chips 
Side by side
Everything I said went right over your head
And I knew you were different just like night and day
There is not a mar that you could see
But in the past
Let me CHILL
They say love is just a waste of time
"Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world"
There’s just something I have to say
you would know it
When you're sick of the same old songs
Baby girl stop frontin'
It feels so good to know ya
People throwing pennies on a wishing well
Making trouble on the double dutch that's how I released
I don’t need someone to love
"Show these motherfuckers how to fucking make a band, uh, uh"
They're gonna rip it off
Soon as you up me on that nigga get to bustin'
Promenade to take with you
You can meet me 45 past 8
"Actin' like a rapper, they all lame"
"We lost time before get up, and it's been a long time coming ~"
Now you speak on my name
It's never ever been here before
I wanna do it baby
My heart was keeping time and we
My friends they see the patterns
And to the fella over there With the hella good hair
This hurt that I’ve been through
I Been through the darkest of caves and suffered
Cuz I don't need no one but you
So I hope morning comes 'round soon
"So trust me,when I say to go"
And I'm running round and round and round just to go nowhere
"Look at that drip, drip, drip, drip"
"All this designer on my body got me drip, drip (ayy)"
"Till you take me there, ooh baby"
"I don't wanna hear your lies, know that you gon' be little"
"Try and stop me, I'm in"
Now when I remember spring
And see your ass shake
"Wasn't here, here"
Oh I'm reaching for all that you are
In my eyes the only truth I see
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
Falling in love with you.
I had to share it with somebody that I really trust
I’m gonna call this destiny and make you fall in love with me
Maybe the pain made a better me (On God)
It's just too hard to walk away and leave me like that
You can be on your own or you can run with the pack
when i keep asking why
You're the only one I ever want.
Everybody go down low
Soaking it all up for fun but now I only soak up wine
Cause you know every morning I wake up
Once I get up I feel better
though they were never true.
why hy hy I lay my heart down on the floor
"Took her shoppin', she think that I'm the shoe plug"
and this is more than love
I’m patching up your scars
Or right when I can't eat
see I lose all my logics on you
I've spent most of my life
I will know your ways
Feel like I've been gone for a while
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
"All my clothes, you were burnin'"
He'd take that whale in tow
"Little  with  the  ill,cross  over  like"
"Drummer Gang the Army, the Navy, we killin' shit , ooh"
"Oh, well I’ll read a story to you."
Nutrition is like how I put them greens on your spine
But then I see your face
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
The road that we've taken is long 'bout no will make it
When we’re on the phone and he talks real slow
"And I just stole his bitch, it's a robbery (Stole it, robbery)"
You really know how to make me cry
"Gave her my hoodie, then called her a Lyft (Woo)"
Shawty she yellow yeah keep me on my toes stay mellow
Do twenty things just to make you laugh
"Long sleeves cover the scars, dark circles under my eyes, yeah"
"My love's understanding (-standing, -standing)"
Can't get enough of the weekend (enough of the weekend)
But ain’t it pretty
I tried to let you go
Chicks were born to give you fever
"You walking through that door now, oh-ooh"
"Yeah, all I want to hear is"
Wanna be is enough for you
"So deally your number 1 fan,damn "
"Over, when you say its over I'm not sober"
If you a real one then you know how to bounce back
"Don't stop, baby, don't tell me that it's over (Don't stop baby)"
Do you love it when you keep me guessin' (Me guessin')
Blinded by the light that's inside
the leaves fell down and the seasons changed
Mistakes I made when I was younger
Built our whole life off his shoulders
"She lookin' for a good time, you know, good vibes"
And I need them all right now inside my hands
"Either go to school, go to jail or the army"
Here we say you broke if everybody gets broke except for you
"Can't do this song on my own,no"
"When you cut me, I don't feel the pain"
Let's not miss out on each other
"Be careful what you wish for, you get what you see"
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
"Oh, how it feels to live forever"
You live in my head without a doubt
there's nothing in return nothing to tell
"Good morning Judge, why do you look so mean?"
am i the type of guy who means what i say
Or look for the light
Sucka mc's gotta wait while I translate
"Nothing special, just like me"
A stranger to my eyes
You're so shook when I catch on fire
"And put this here, In CloudMusic"
We completely lost control
And you’re pressing your cheek against me
I don’t believe in that 
Cold blood when it opens and closes
Even when i downfall
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
I'd rather push on all your buttons to start a fight
Now you telling' me that I should fight it
"Lightning, best show that I've ever seen"
To  drift  away  leave  it  all  behind
Gotta go home tonight with you by my side
"Used to be a player, now I’m coach"
"I check it, I wreck it, I turn it around"
"So, baby, don't you let it go to waste"
We've been waiting on all our lives
I don't want nobody else
Forget all I said just look at the way
Drinks in Ibiza
You were good for me in bad way
My heart beats for you night and day
faint' spoken lyrics...all questionable
And we will only be making it right
"Lay me on my tummy, put it in my stomach"
"Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded,"
I hope that you having you a good year
"We had time, we had love, we had everything"
My gates are strong but you're my weakness
We don't have much besides our love and
"Went and got her body right, oh, yes"
It's possibility and sociality
Being drunk and weary I went to Mollys chamber
"Yeah, you're not rid of me"
But i wanna see the places in his dreams he seems to love 
"Her touch is just like an ocean, still I'm drowning"
"You ask me if this love is worth the end (Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh)"
It was starting to snow
"we've been a long, long way"
what happened to the things  that you said
"shit in my parker, that shit 'll go blocka'"
"Said, I saw the tape that you"
"all the things you want to hear, "
"We don't talk like we used to and I hate that,I hate that"
Just in the darkest depths of mordor
You don’t know how reckless you are You made me blue
Now we can't get on the green
And shut me down before I even start
See love in your eyes
You wouldn't pass it off
She be rollin' up exotic oh oh
Don't take it back now
There's never a day I don't want you back
Oh finally I feel alive inside
You got me in a state of mind
"Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight"
Good things come to those who wait
But the ceiling fan keeps spinning
Wind and the waves will set me free
We're living different lives
You always used to talk about L.A.
Heading now with my friends
Just starting to crawl.
"It might be a little while, but"
"I wake up without you, boy"
You know my lovin' is no sweat
I don't want to get things confused
"There’s no doubt about it,"
Am I sitting in a tin can
And I played my guitar too loud.
Yeah I only throw it down if it's safe to bet
"Gave you all my money, gave you all my money"
"Knitted lace out of lashes, battered with ashes"
She's looking in my eyes now I see no other guys
I don’t need a piece of worn-out cloth that can cover my eyes
It all thru your eyes
We'd take on the world together
"where was you when I needed you the most, don’t call me friend"
"China’s, with me"
Have to come to an end
"So say something now, say something now"
Your feelings now you wanna talk
"You know it's my time, my life"
we both know I'm not what you need
You gave me a reason to faithfully trust
"Need some music you can listen to, I narrow down the search"
"Past the point of no return, the final threshold -"
"The way it was when we were growing older,"
How I have loved and learned life's lessons
Cause a day no one knows you return and you'll be happy.  
But I know that you need someday
And we bussin bottles
White just to make you blue
Come and rescue me
Say you wanna be a new man with your new lover
When you said that this is hard to see through
Everything jaded (Jaded)
"Cup of coffee, thinking maybe, could be wrong but"
We used to have and leave a mark
So they get behind me'
Oh what should I do I'm just a little baby
And if I say it enough
Than anything I have read in my whole life
Any other day i would call
lets make it worth
It's so lost in my moments
"Worn like a mask of self-hate,"
But it's just me and my gang ready to fuck up the game
I thought I would find you
Two strangers in perfect time
"Im tryna get it yankin, throwin hella franklins"
Sky's reaching out I want it
Who would ever thought that they
Spinning out like Mercury
Straight down the 405
"La,la,la,la,la,la, (come and get your love)"
You've got the heart to take the pain away
Everybody knows
Me with some nerve
To make something of my life
Woah-woah-woah-woah
But things
And it make no correlation
But I'm not that girl anymore
I’ll pick a fight somehow
"He said, ""Bless the farmer"
"Both of us want to be the winner, but there can only be one"
So why hang on to me? 
Told the crowd that I have food poisonin'
Makes me feel this way
If my eyes are brown or blue
I want you to see things clearly
I promise that when I come back to Jakarta that y’all gon be proud of the shit that I built
"Baby, let me know if you're alive"
(There is a price)
Hey baby we can dance slowly
Of something I didn't even know that I ruined
Sorry I dragged you into this
Let me treat you right
"To the body count (yeah, yeah)"
But she knew it's too late
The kind of touch that made me chasing down
"Call us white trash, like we're someone they know (They know, they know, they know)"
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Take me to the fire burning
Now my body even lets me drin
We ain t playin wit cha
"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
"out by the pool,behind the fence"
Living life
You got what I need
And all the dust is following me
"Shout out to the ones that still with me, those are my guys"
To see you sideways
"Heeey, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray"
"There is love in the world, I know it all"
I got nothing else to say but
All she want is not to be ignored
Cause I hate it that I need ya
I'm gonna sink down with it too
"Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission"
Don't know why
To make history
i'm about to give her all of her grandkids.
We will never be the same
I’m sure you got some things
I wake up still in a daze
I love what you've done to me
I watch the whole room change
"You're takin' your clothes off, you look in the mirror"
"Man, why can't life always be this easy"
What good would it do
We drank your father’s whiskey when your grandma died
Without you I don't know who I'd be
"But beneath the hype, are they the type you'd turn to in a pinch?"
"One of these lone days, waking up when things"
A truth so loud you can't ignore
"Not really a believer, oh-oh"
"Lost in the moment, know where it's going"
"Like, the boogeyman comin' (Boogeyman)"
We on a fucking mission Expedition Navigator
Stayed and chasing the feelings we had yeah
Trying to find some peace and quiet
"I’m just saying, give it a chance"
I hear her on my door
Slept next to her but
Now when we talk (it never fails)
Durk the voice 'cause he know just what to say
"Na, na na na na, na na na na"
But I'll go down to the honkytonk
And I’m just happy getting A to B
"Of love and life,"
In this world we live
I've been falling much more deep
"When you need that fire, I'm your Messiah"
Work flow
Sat on a fence but it don't work
"I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine"
Floatin' this creek
Hoping I might see you sooner
Could you change my life
That he's a liar
If you only knew what I talk about
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
No victors in this game
I've forgotten all I know. 
And watched the fire burn through the night
Consequence
Reminds me that there's time to change' hey' hey
no I know you're thinking about me
As deep as I could in them jeans
"Early in the morning,"
As long as I am with you my heart continues to beat
I tell you something that just ain't cool
"Do it just like you love and you care (ay, ay)"
Until the next one comes
The plans that you made
You don't wanna know how far we could go
til you're really in control
One thousand times in my head
Suffocating every time it locks me in
Never thought you’d make my love a secret
If you ever cared to ask
"A hemisphere with no fear, fly over"
There's vacancy in your eyes
You stabbed in my back
You've got a heart as loud as lions
But you just gotta let me know
Lost in your emerald eyes
by which we measure
I be with bitches that be with bitches
You're better than the rest
"I got your hey oh, now listen what I say oh"
Frightened eyes
So don't try and tell me that you're happy for me now
sexy music on the wall
I want you so I got you
You and I'll be safe and sound
All the girls in here are fly
We once were from together
But if you think that could I look you in your face and lie right  Through my teeth
Balancin' on breaking branches
"To hold your girl in your arms is wonderful, wonderful"
let's light it up
Since a twist of fate
"Money in the mattress, love the way I stack it"
You don't know nothing
Come on skinny love what happened here
We gon' have to send it up then
"That comes with the territory,"
find romance on your menu
"I got a penthouse on both coasts, pH balance"
Why am I still here?
"I got hella range, yeah you know my music timeless"
Everybody thinks I'm crazy
I know words won't be enough
Know it's not okay
Never take the chance
The voice inside of you
"Then you dance, ah, then you dance, ah"
Not getting enough from you
She’s addicted to the Fame
I wan' feel your body on my body
"Keeping me away from you,"
Come on
48 hours in love
I'ma play ball with the big boys
This feeling lasts so long
I was cast to distant Pohjola
"I said I hate you, I was angry"
The day you slipped away
"Maybe we'll make it, oh"
"The old woman took her hand in hers, and walked her down the path."
I will find a way back to
I'm a winner these days
"Spoke from my skull, I dreamed"
"Yeah, we're taking off"
Everybody's always on me
And all I can taste is this moment
When you thought the world was easy
"You told me to grow up, but I just can’t help myself"
To go under the surface? 
Instead of I love you so
I didn't mean to confuse your mind
36 hours and I'm back where I started
"When the sky was falling,"
Know commitment can be hit or miss
"I'm the M-I-double-S-S, yo' best best, bitch from V-A-"
"And I know, and I got"
you're singing every day.
With love on the line
"No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored"
I'm in my own lane yeah I don't need your help
I want you all to myself
"And it's enough, knowing you are calling to me"
But they just can't kill the beast
And all I need's a great big congratulations
And all my worries are then gone by night
If I just spread my wings I can fly~~~
"Lookin' for fun, gettin' high for free"
"Lost but not forgotten, from the dark heart of a dream,"
Travel two thousand kilometers to hang out with us
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
"I don't relate to you (No, I don’t)"
Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Can I calm down for a moment
True colors are beautiful
There's no sense in losing sleep
Inside this room
It's a hungry home
"You know I'm trying, in the end"
I think you should knuckle up
"Hey you, stay"
"Girl, l'm tryna give you this"
Got me lookin' at my life this year
There's a photograph
Who do I talk to in my sleep?
"""say my darling, you are wonderful tonight"""
"She like, ""Send me a text"""
You Cant Trust The News
Clocks strikes upon the hour
I just gotta keep believing and I've heard
We're never gonna find the answers
The beavers are so cute 
But tonight we can be...
I wish I could unmiss you
The people we used to be
Swear you always blame it all on me
To find a way to show you
I know we're meant for life
Let it go
You look at me
I'm figurin' that's why they call me faithful
I don't wanna tryna be 'til end of time
cross my mind
Tellin' myself now
I can't keep up with your step
Should find a betta way to handle it
I got problems with attachment
Into your life it will creep
be bright together. 
I don’t want it no more
Let's just be friends
Never knew when we would let it go
By  and  by  we  do  some  growing  up
I found myself an angel called you
"Silk, dampened, unknown, over final thoughts"
If we ever get to see it all
I don't care if I get on your nerves
baby hold me tight
So I wrote this little song hoping you would hear someday
I can't remember when we last expressed
"But if I don't, can you please remind me?"
People never change just move on
I'm not crazy
"don’t bail on reality, either see your dreams become true or stay a fantasy"
All this shit's so insane
Thanking God on bended knee
Seem to hold your words aloft
And if I got one more chance
Three second later
Let’s stay in bed while all our friends go out (but you don’t mean it)
The last chance to get it right
Cause I spent every moment with you
"Wake up, eat, school, repeat"
The more I think about it now
And all of my friends say
I hope he loves you like I do
Won't you love me
That has come to take the place of you
"Got you wantin' more, been the one that I adore"
Pop culture was in art
All the things they're all about
You don’t have to worry about me
Back to a place you'd already known
somebody new
The one love I'll never replace
New dream is losing its shine and
Baby I don't need you
And I was needing someone new to find me
The love that I seek is it hidden beneath
Break down these walls and come on in
You rip me open
We all know the end is coming
"Gave her head, she facin' backwards (backwards, ayy)"
I feel like I have a disadvantage
Better on my own
Take care of your soul
"The keys and the codes, and know where all of the safes is"
Cannonball right into the deep end
Put the seeds into your hands and throw them in the sky
I'll be getting over you my whole life
I need you
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
"Baby, come through on a late night creep"
Don’t I think that’ll make you think?(yeah)
"Depend on the week, I'm prolly gonna have to achieve"
I need a trip to Jamaica (Yeah)
"Kiss it, kiss it better baby"
So I'mma take your hand and hold it
"Everybody's busy, can't wait for the night to begin"
Feeling bad about my hangover Sunday
If bein' country was in the Bible
No risk so I think I'm all in
so don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'
"baby i know that you're what i'm fightin' for,"
Will love still be in your heart
"Reach into my soul, come where you belong"
I was afraid to leave you on your own
I would know where to find love
I wonder if you ever really want me
Sometimes I feel like giving up
And stab you man behind
I got new friends and 8 tattoos
"Shawty, you're the whole reason, yeah"
Know that I've been
Don't gotta entertain anybody else
"All up in my feelings, all up in my past"
get over it
I found the love that I thought was gonna last
I know I am full of flaws
Why you're here
You're the only one keep my demons tame
And let that mistake pass on
Like Tokyo in the spring
Pray that God is merciful and hope that I see 28
Cause I need you more than you want me
"I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies"
Dreaming of a past that couldn't last
Yes it stoned me to my soul
We found ourselves in stage three
Even in this state of mind
It’s hard to be anywhere these days
Cause I want to
Don't wanna be the same
Your love is one in a million
Blue flashes in my eyes
Cash flow wet now that I stopped my getting high
Put all your sh-t in the elevator
Down to my last match fire I touch just to feel
"I saw ‘em clashing, I can’t hear ya"
I ain't no joke' I can't be stopped
"I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it,"
Just like an animal in the moonlight
"Has He defeated death, Hell in the grave and sin itself?"
He hates that he can't say I'm wrong (Can't say I'm wrong)
I've been dancin' through the storm
Unification when you're just tired of trying
With all your light
life could be beautiful.
"I saw'love without a niche, please"
Without you baby child
I'm chilling
Too shy baby baby
"Yeah, I think I'm giving up"
So  tell  me  right  away
It's the only time you look at me
Now you're cummin'
How it'd be right now (How it would be)
"Yep, I'm a cutie in my own way"
Black and white turn to colour all around
"Well, I can handle that"
I know I saw you last night
But I don't know at all
In love to make my systems go
I Brushed off the dust and then I buried all the stress
Now tell me who's the man to show you how
You must be some kinda fucked up
I got a bed but I’d rather be in yours tonight
Girls like you
If we could stay high together 
Now a nigga can't answer calls cause I'm ballin'
I keep you inside
"I Got Your Slippers, Your Dinner, Your Dessert, And So Much"
If you taste a little bit of my love
With love song yeah
They’ll live on forever
Million dollar lick but I missed out
"Hold up, wait, ice skate (Yeah, yeah)"
I broke down and rate it half the fridge
All the pieces fit
I owe you
It's too much for my heart to take so just
I’ll take your hand
Hold it over me
"Deep breaths coming in and out, one kick and I'm coming down"
You know I'll love you at your worst (At your worst)
And we would be here again
"So hungry for you, taste me and I'll taste you"
know what I mean
Your love is a one in a million it goes on and on and on
Say yes to me
been calling my phone tryna waste my time
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
What I got to do to be heard?
I speak but they don't listen
And swim every ocean
It's hard for me to let go of you
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse now
Bury your head on a Monday morning
Take another step into the no-man's land
"You could ever want, it's in my arms"
I said sometimes
Without you now
"Yeah, you were my only source (Source)"
Clouds are passing by
"She rockin' Hermes now, doing it calmly"
"You, me, youre abusing"
Could be winter but I burn inside
That this isn’t a false start
two stacks of that benjamin franklin
"Told you from the jump (Jump), I can't give you what you want"
"Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers"
At first I didn't think you had a hold of me
I met someone who loves me like I never could
I was a different man
lalalalalalalala
and make it all your own
Turn the lights on
We walked along a crowded street
Give me what I want
"It's a touch, it's a reason"
So stay in your corner
That you can't be scared to try
Drop it to di floor an mek mi see your energy because
"Pounds, I got more of those, why my eyes sorta low"
"Trust issues, no more"
I know you know
We'll be monsters
Lie in bed and pour a drink of me?
"And the stress that it brings, start to wonder if it's worth it"
How many nights I been (Woah)
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
There's more to me than people know
Cause half of my world
"Message on read, was kinda livid"
"Come come, come come, go"
"Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her"
I got to pay for my whole family's rent and then some
Red red red red red red redneck?
Memories bring back you
All I ever asked was you to
one that lifts your heart along
"Ooh, let's make it happen tonight "
We're beautiful
"That's my baby lover, but"
"(Make, and not a lot of time"
"I'm actually depressed, okay?"
But now it's all been erased
I was lost you found a way to bring me back
Lost all your thoughts deep inside the sea
I'm supposed to be a man so I'm supposed to act tough?
You're nothing like other
You don't have to tеll me that
The dick hang out the end
Let me understand all your worries
Freak who just don't care (Freak who just don't care)
I don't think you'll understand
maybe then you will see
(There's something 'bout that girl)
Reflecting on the moon
Can I keep myself together? Gotta keep the tunnel vision
But I know you stuck with tunnel vision
While i'm drinking jack all alone in my local bar
Because the night belongs to lust
When love and trust are gone
But I keep falling in
under the april sun
"Spend a lot of time with you, I can't let go"
I hope they didn't get your mind
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
Only thing that's burning when the nights grow cold
"To my niggas down the road, one call at a time"
Next thing you know
We can take it slow
They know what is what
You should've knew that I was coming
And I feel life for the very first time
"Yea we bout to board, so tell me what you waitin on"
Shine through the rain
Put your hand on my thigh
I been here a while
By the count of 10
So what is right and what is wrong
"""We're sorry. All circuits are busy."""
At that coffee shop
So let my body make your mind up
All of my change I spent on you
It gets way too hard when I need to think
"Is anybody real here, I need some fact checks"
"Still bustin' off forty-four,"
"I call you what it is, a natural blend together."
Drawing out the disappearing owls
"Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain, hmm)"
I know I’m not the best but I won’t stop until the end
(I know I can face it)
You can lay your hands on me.
Cause l always respect your space
"Mase, you know ain＇t nuttin changed but my limp"
I promise you I'mma shout you out
Wishing I could wake up and be next to you
"Rocking yellow diamonds, but no Pittsburgh"
trappin but I'm trapped
I'm doing fine
Read my lips
"Times that we have, so wild, can't forget that"
"This is my life, I ain't telling no lies"
I swear I learned my lesson
But she's not into guys
And again the kisses
"I should stop drinking, I should stop smoking"
it's been occurring to me i'd like to hang out with you for my whole life
Maybe it's the way it's supposed to be
Cuz it's not that simple
I want you to be shine bright
"Where do I go, in the after life"
In a La-la land machine
I feel the weight
"Break it down like blueprint (Lights out, blueprint)"
West virginia mountain momma
Cause when we're at the edge of no return
Imma be spreadin my wings
But she just smiled and turned away
"Ah, ooh, I miss it all"
Brothers be on the corners
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
You sold your soul but couldn't win it back
"Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight"
"You make it so, you make it so,"
But I need a radio inside my hand
But this dirt's in my eyes from the dust off the path
I just lean my seat back and treat your shoulder like a pillow
"You have to listen to your inner voice on your life path. But as for how to choose, Ning Zetao should be quite conscious."
"On the surface, the online social platform expands our social circle and reduces people's loneliness."
"The sphere of influence of social networking not only replaces the traditional telephone contact, but also gets down to the offline living circle, quietly changing the current social life."
"The benefits of online social network are obvious, convenient and quick, so it is particularly favored by young people."
A survey of college students' social habits showed that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours on mobile phone and are almost inseparable to mobile phones during their daily lives.
"""Social network features low cost, fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication among several people. This meets the requirement of modern college students."""
"Expanding the interpersonal relationship circle, more equal dialogue, avoiding social concerns are the major reasons for us to be fascinated with online chat."
It is a lot more difficult to be famous in the entertainment circle by just relying on good appearance than training.
