We're in our jewels in the swimming pool
"Cus you are my universe, my everything, my sunset"

"Love our pros and our flaws, all that makes us who we are"
"All these diamonds that's on me, they necessary"

"Won't brick me up, won't fence me in"
Footsteps are followin' me all night long
I Wanted You To Feel The Same -  The Radio Dept
If I fall in love again it's probably with a Saudi chick
And we can just forget about feeling down
You try to convince me that it's for the best
"But you don't need to know now, you don't need to know how I'm doing"
"Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh"
Cause I haven't bought you and I haven't sold me
Somone more stable and better at puttin' you first
"Uh-huh, look, I can see your face in Parisian paintings"
"I can't fight it(hey), I can't hide it (hey)"
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
Emptiness and pain inside is all I ever felt
Deep inside me I'm fading to black I'm fading
"Wait, it's 5 AM yet I know what you're thinking"
Now my heart feel like an ember and it's lighting up the dark
He keep the angels all around me when I ride through the city
"When you pull me in, I guess we were never friends"
"That this world is a puzzle, I'll find all of the pieces"
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
It's a white heat six feet on top of the roof
"But I'm still zaggin', and I'm still saggin'"
"You make it look easy, I don’t understand"
"Sometimes, when you thought you found the love of your life (Ooh, ooh, ooh)"
Everything that I do is to love you old school
"I wanna feel your summertime, wanna feel the heat"
So why you tryna be just like the neighborhood?
Don't you know I'm human too
But I hope you know I mean it (Mean it)
Or maybe I won't ever say what's in my head
"I can stay by my lonely if there's a whole winter (Oh, oh)"
"Put my hand in her face, send her back where she from, uh"
Slept on me all my life my time has gone

You lift my soul beyond the stars
"Now, you in my burn book, f!ck you and what's her name"
"I thought he was whack and they didn't even like 'em (Ha, shit)"
"Fifty one of this stuff, how I'm gonna manage?"
until the fellas start the name callin'
"My mind right now, I don't wanna play no games"
Til the man of her dreams comes along picks her up and puts her over his shoulder
Love so soft that you can't rub off
"I've been growing up with it, for all my life"
Ask em if they seen you passin by?
If your better off that way （better off that way）
"I cut off the ladder, and I told 'em, ""bye-bye"""
"Baby don't play with me, I'm not the one"
I must admit I feel it too sometimes
It's cool you feel the same
Don't stay away too long and if it was up to me
"I spent a hundred K the next day, I was bored (Okay, okay, yeah)"
Hoping it would come soon so that they could die.

"Cause I don’t want to go, no more"
"I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring"
"So down, hit ground when I'm going low"
Funny how it's over now
"Cause I want you, I want you, I want you"
That was back in Pontiac in my old place
"He said, if he can't hit my bullseye, he'd rather die"
Even-if I break into your house
Losing him was blue like I’d never known
Get your things no I don't want them
"Darling, if we're falling sparks we'll fly and"
"It's hard for me to believe it's real, so I must be dreamin'"
My mistakes prolly wipe all the rights I've done
I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know
I will miss you torn apart after tonight
It never goes the way that you planned
I dunno who you been dealing with
Used to rock wife beaters now I let your wife beat me
And every compliment just sounds like you're no good at all
"Beautiful as the sky even if you feel blue, blue, blue, blue"
"Would you say no, or let your body take control"
"And you'll never find,and you'll never find"
"I could fall asleep and stare in your eyes, we’ll dance all night"
"These bitches be lying, I ain't got the time"
Watchin' mama cry while shе ate everything in the kitchen (Yeah)
And I'll never break away (Can't break free)
When she walks down the street all the cats flip
"Lockin' it down, lockin' it down, lockin' it down, I want you (I want you)"
Don't cry snowman don't you fear the sun
Said I could take the bottom drawer so that's what I did
If we’re rushing in we’ll do it steadily
"She got that killer, killer grip, am I dead?"
You can close it off and turn it away
N!ggas really faking just to hang around
And you know I stay with bands on me like my name Katie (What?)
"See all the wings in the front, it's us"
Even when I waka with ten toes
"I told ’em put the rest of it up, we got to hold out"
And her daddy's gone and she needs someone
Kris Kross show 'em how it's done   
We're just a room full of strangers
But that's where we're different
It's kind of funny cause all I ever needed was you
"I've had enough of you, and your super-bad crew"
Who will be the next to flex and face death
never makes me feel alright like it used to
You know that you're safe with me
"For he’s captured your heart in a way I never could ,"
You straight?

The ways I loved you.
"Mandem hit my line like, ""Some niggas just got hit up on yo' block"""
I treated you like a friend so you feel comfortable
I been drippin' thru the summa turning nights into days
"This is my version of watching you die, took me by surprise"
"Cause I just keep stepping on squares, these numbers increase"
"Cause all these streets, they make me high "
Thinking what to do if I'm beyond repair
"Know I said let's not end up in bed, but"
Some days I get scared to be alone
"Can we rewind, go back to last night"
I stick shit deep inside her throat where it ain't no more breathin'
"But I have some spice, and I want them plain"
And the night goes down and runs around the angelic nights creatures
"I'm the only one who truly knows you best, baby"
"She keep running back, though, only 'cause I pay up"
"Anywhere I go, I know you're always there"
"I’m seeing stars, I promise I will trust you no more"
"I was eighteen still when I got my deal, then Dre had to go up the road (Up the road)"

"With a note, scribbled out in pencil"
"Poppin’ bottles at the club, gettin' more drinks at the bar"
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
You say that I’m acting different when I stop pretending
"I be gettin' hella high, rockstar like Cobain"
But I know I am trying to find a way to make this work
"But I ain't got the proof, so I just keep pretendin'"
"Ain't nothin', ain't nothin', gon' stop me from makin' it happen"
Son I just want you to have a better life than me
Let me set this straight from this mess Imade’ve
If I had a normal coming of age
"I touch your soul when you hear me say, ""Boy"""
Down like six thirty (Down like six thirty)
"Baby, take a chance"
From the bottom of my heart but you got me fooled
Red pill 'cause don't take the blue one
With me in control We can switch roles
"Who's gonna save me now (who gon, who gon)"
This world needs somebody like you
"Drive out of the city, away from the crowds."
And hopes that things start changing someday soon
"Oh, dear boy, it’s so hollow without you"
"I feel your eyes, they're locked on every part of me"
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets
I will hold you in the depths of your despair
"You're coming home late, screaming and then you runaway"
My chains new gold watch made in China
Gasp for days but it's out of my hands
Im'a call her. Then I put the mack down.
situation got me notice how we couldn’t make it far
So somebody wake me in October
"Yeah, I like it when you don’t say nothing"
I hear the wolves calling my name no surrender
Above the raging waters and the darkness underneath
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer
"I'm a prodigy, R.I.P Thun-Thun"
elastic 
Damn it but don't you know that I will be there
On the road in ’93
"I like a big beard, I like a clean face"
All if I'm gonna give it my all gonna give it till I can't go back
Who left me now you wanna call the shots 
But something told me that it wouldn't last
"Before I let you do that, I would have killed a hundred niggas"
If I'd be 'him' and you'd be 'her'
"I'm losing sleep, yeah you stole it"
"Oh, yeah, baby, you've been in your bag, bag (You've been in your bag)"
Blood and sweat and tears
"I'm very young, love me"
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
of the man in that lincoln is telling me to
"Oh no, we're breaking where we're bound"
"Get the picture, different from when I met ya"
"Ice cold drinks 'til the moon light, you're my holiday"
It's time again now to pay for my dreams
"Hittin' like Ike, singin' like Tina"
"I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'"
"From B.I.G. and Paris, Three Times Dope, and some we'll never see, and PRT"
"Far from flawless always reckless, can I borrow your forgiveness"
You gonna be visiting heaven but might not get in it
But I'm not the type to do your name wrong
When I look up at the sky I only see the vision
Baby you gon' make me overnight it
You're just born to be seen
Realize they come out and love at night
"This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh,"
When I see another brother lose the life he built
It's better than waiting for you call.
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
Just  stay  with  me  now  Say  the  word  and  we  ll  go
I feel the same but still like don't know how we happend
And there's a dazzling haze
"I copped a Rolls Royce, it cost me four-fifty"
What if we just go back loving again
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet
"Givenchy, Gabbana I know that you want it"
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
"What would you do, could you tell me if you knew"
"I feel so lonely,I'm waiting for you"
"Put it on my neck, now my neck is a nuisance (Yeah)"
One time with me won't change your life
It's looking like dreams only dance behind my eyes
"I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could"
I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
"""I'm everywhere you never been, and better than I ever been"""
Somebody save me from the madness
"Tear me up inside, and you break me down"
"No one compеtes, you're all I need"
"Don't even rap, I just vent to you"
Yea maybe I could be that
"You take yourself with you, you can't run from yourself"
When I'm still breaking
"They be like, ""Popp, why you walk like that?"
"After hours, baby think I’m cheating ‘cause I’m in the shower"
They want my treasure so they get their pleasures from my photo
After sex we never follow through
I fell hard in your arms tonight It was nice
"Bein' a real one is my motto, handle my problems, I ain't scared"
Everything I see is grey and I can't believe
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I can't even begin to explain why this isn't so fair
I told her I got five on me send me the wire Ooh
"They wanna sleep on my crib, let me go and get you soft t-shirt here (Soft tee)"
"As the sad-eyed woman spoke we missed our chance,"
I think it's all in my mind
"Super clutch I'm in the fourth just like Ginobili,  yeah."
Why we greedy like wolves?
In and out of love and life I'll fall and run away
As the song goes by I miss you more and more
This'll have to wait for the other side
"I preach what I practice, these streets all I've known"
I know half of these rappers were gimmicks (On gang)
Tryna have the fam eating like it’s Thanksgiving
We’re talking just to waste time
It's a problem with few then we straightenin' it (Straight)
I ain't talkin' Ash Kaashh but that b!tch she be my header
"Done looking for the critics, cuz they're everywhere"
Watch your mouth when you speak my name
"Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"
And cut up peaches and them brown eyes
"Lord, I can't go back home this a way."
Baby take my hand and ride the waves with me
"You make it all make sense, it's easy"
i  would  never  wanna  love  again
Let's keep it fun and simple
But they can see my nose grow long right through the phone
"For evеry shot you're taking, I'm taking two"
Well my heart is broken I'm trying can't you see can't you see
And there's nothing I can do or say to change your mind or numb the pain
She a bougie ghetto girl so they mad bitch and
Goin each and every place with the mic in their hand
Where you broke down I didn't leave ya
bet you think that everything good is gone
"My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer"
I had a Bugatti and then I woke up in the trap (yeah)
And they say that it goes so I hope that it shows
Got you riding 'round in all type of Benzes and Rovers
You were my candle through the darkness when I gave in
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
I  can't  say  that  I'll  love  you  forever
Like they was down with the old me
You don't even need a scale to know I'm on top
Wanna laugh when others cry
"I’ll acapella karaoke “sexy Thing”, cause baby I feel no shame"
"I'm a party girl, and I'm just warnin' you"
Fiesty but you're screaming to cover me
Let's make out in this Lexus
And if there is a God they'll know why it's so hard
"Fonem rack shit like a barber, Glock gon' knock off his facial hair"
But the one little duck with the feather on his back
"The sun will lead us, our reason to be here"
"Well, can't you hear the ""miss you"" in my voice?"
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
They said they don't see what you see in me
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
"With you to my right, I'm alright. I'm ok"
"I said look at that lion, she reminds me of you"
"I can meet somebody, but tell me, what's the use?"
"And time can heal, but this won't"
"He don't matter, see it in your in eyes"
"Girl, I can't see my reflection"
"Cause I miss your voice, it's a mystery that"
"Cause the world can wait, the world can wait"
"But now I know a perfect way to let you go,"
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Riding rollercoaster till I see the sunrise
Dreamt a picture and you don't know how it hurts
And I couldn’t give a reason
"I ain't surpised by my baby-momma, she don't amaze me"
"Hold tight, 'cause you been trippin' all night"
I'm acting like a lovesick fool(Stupid cupid)
I'm so easy just one touch and i'm already yours
"But it's kinda fun, even if we know it's wrong"
I'd rather have hard times together than to have it easy apart
We do it to try to do without tryin
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
"Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star"
"I'll take you dancin' in the country, Levi's in them low beams"
Know you the queen of givin' ideas
"You are so close, but far away"
What it means to be in love again
My love he makes me feel like nobody else
Loving may be all you can give it
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
That we can't keep getting that paper (I don't know)
Well she said she'd stick around until the bandages came off
Cause your love's got the best of me
"Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but me"
I'm thinking when did you become so special
"Hold out your hand, let the stars shoot again"
"Burn it down, burn it down, speedin' down ready"
"I know that I control my thoughts, And I should stop reminiscing"
"From a distance, I can hear you say my name"
"Change my number, keep them other ho's from callin'"
Like a hunter waiting for the season
Oh placing your hand touch me again.
And i love it when we ride side by side
Maybe ina dream i’ll find a clue
So when the yearningfull illusion takes the upper hand
"Your eyes, ready for takeoff, melt in your head"
There was no time for make believe and all the magic slipped away
Sold enough gas to go buy me a Texaco (Good petrol)
But in the light of you they somehow get replaced
It takes half the Western world just to keep my ship afloat
As you can 'cause I promise time will go
No don't get upset when you see me 'cause I didn't wanna give you up
Trippin off you cause you had your shot
"Don't say what you want to, yeah"
How long will it take ‘till I’m in luxury
And sweat drips off your body
"In front of some sket who wanted bit on your        Nah, I’m just messing"
She read your mind and called it her terror
"I'll be your first time, that's so right"
"I had your type before, no I don't want that back"
"Get help', they might suggest Trash talk, I take offence"
And if I'm hot shot mom will cut my hair at night
All these heads be turnin' when I walk in
But it's cool it's fine as you start to doze
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Cause I don't think you feel me now
But I wanna be where the lights are shining on me
"Santa's gonna come and make you mine, oh oh oh"
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks.
"For every shining second, this fragile body beckons"
"How to paint a smile, yeah, how would we know"
"Get on the boat now, we got room for a hundred more"
"Boy you make it, make it right"
"Yeah, we should keep this easy breezy"
They wipe his nose if I say so (Yeah)
"Mmm, If you can picture it, it's real (mhm)"
I pull your hair and talk dirty
And that's rule three I'm the school T
"Inspired by the cycles of the womb, the rhythms of a human experience."
You better slow down if you're not speakin' truth
I aint no casanova but I swear this much is true
"Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new)"
The days are bright and filled with pain
"And I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me together"
"I wanna let go but it's so complicated baby all I'm saying is, what's the situation?"
"Crack a collar bone, snap with da bass right at yo dome"
"You know that I wish I, I could turn back time to the perfect night with you"
Can't stop me cause I'm reviving
Stayed at home should’ve listened for the first time
I won't live with myself if your feet touch the ground
Soak me up like a mop know i'm up know there's levels
"He's smiling down on me and you, yeah"
I got a heart like a truck
But we'll remember the best time
But I know that can see us through
"Sometimes, my heart only wants to ache (Shu-bop, bop)"
The future that we hold is so unclear
Don't got no chips then don't sit at my table yeah
I can try to make some but I don't really want to
I could be your ingenue
"I've been rolling with some bad dude, bad dudes"
I'd hold you tight and probably sing you a lullaby
I know that I should be happy but I just feel hollow again
"I wanna see you giddy up and get wild, yeah"
before you hurt yourself' I think that you'll be doin just fine
"So let's go there, let's make our escape"
All we know that love was for when we're older
"I pray to God everyday, but I know I’m a sinner"
Would you call and say you want this?
Might have a little static but it's alright
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
"I try to picture me without you but I can't,"
Look me in the eyes I'm not afraid
A finder with the fever for the fame was all I ever want
Until you played with me emotions and you made me cry'
What can I do to make it up to you?!
“I mean it doesn’t matter if she does at this point.”
Your Fist Clenched My Neck We'Re Neck And Neck...
"Big fat check, I'ma need it by yesterday."
"I was nowhere to be found, I hate the crowds, you know that"
I wouldn't trade the wealth from Wall Street
Don’t ever question you cause I don’t ever have to
"Who claim that they got you, but clearly that's not true, uh"
"I'm paralyzed (Yeah, I'm just so paralyzed)"
And I'll be quick to block your number
"What you want, what you want, what you want"
I'm not a stranger to goodbye
"Well, I'm crashing through the floor"
I'll be smokin' KK til' you think I'm unconscious
"Got me crumbling down, crumbling down, baby brick by brick"
"I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,"
You'd act like it's for me hmm hmm
"The journey's long, but we will celebrate"
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
And freak this dest just like Ashford and Simpson
"When I think 'bout that, I get claustrophobic"
And when i reached jamaica i made a stop
I don’t wanna be someone who can just figure it out (testing out my temper)
I know when I have children they will know what it means
Didn't I tell you I'ma get my way
Is the grass really greener or am I just color blind?
"You make me happy (Happy, happy)"
Until that day I see you again
"Turned up the city, I broke off the notch"
"Take me home, take me one step higher"
So I could buy C3PO
Drunk on a feeling alone with the stars in the sky
"Saturday, runaway, get out of the circus"
"Nigga, this that '06 Gucci Mane"
By a white knight on a white horse in a white cape
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
"You met up with me inside a dream, our future was shown"
"I should've listened to my mama, she saw through you from the start"
"Now that you know, this is my life,"
I will laugh out loud cause we don’t know
"Against all odds, we must strive for essential gains"
AK-47 'round my arm like a shoulder pad
"Face facts, for you I lost my head"
"rich on my own, I brought it home and now my family proud"
"Need something out here, my connects up"
Cuz I'm making a connection
I just met the prettiest girl I've ever met
it go to show you never can tell
"If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby"
"I fell so hard right in the moment when I met you, oh"
"She wears high heels, I wear sneakers"
"I mopped the floor, now watch me sweep up these M's, cause I- (Ah)"
I ain't no psychiatrist I ain't no doctor with a degree
And I'm flying away but I think I saw some turbines turning beneath me
Will we grab ice cream and coffee at the mall?
"In the dead of the night, I see your face in my mind"
"Drop that ass to the floor, and let me see you give me"
"I pop my shit, she topless, these niggas ain't stoppin' shit (Woo, woo)"
"I hide my pain behind these frames, but baby, you"
"See girlfriend if you let him, let him he'll try and take your soul"
We are everywhere in the ocean and a blade of grass
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby
Cause all i do is dream about you
We don't give a damn it ain't you we care about
"There are those who won't see you as a person, just success"
I've been chasing everything that makes me feel cold
I wanna Just Dance
But I know the homies lookin' at me like I have the ways
"Flashing light, oh what a night"
"Lately I been, I been losing sleep"
Cause I’m all tired out and I'm no use to you
Did you more than I'll right be there every morning in some my lungs than that
You got me shaking and I don’t know why
"Cousin Dre sent me scriptures, helped me see life better"
"If I cut my hair, hope I grow it long"
You didn't let me down' you didn't tear me apart
"Losing him was blue, like I've never known"
"Yeah, we're good, but we can do better"
Yo ay girl yo bring it back to the time when you and me had just begun
"but I got whatever she needs, yeah"
Got me wishing that we did the things we didn't do
Got a Rollie sitting on my wrist just like a parakeet
You played games and it ended
But there's somethin' that the papers forgot
"Well, Some nights, I wish that this all would end"
Thought I smelled your ghost in my winter coat
Let's live tonight like fireflies
upgrade 
When they tell me it's better to let go
No ship when I get a new rocket
Don't wanna hear that sound if you're not around
I get a shot right through into a bolt of blue
"But in my head oh you say, say you still want it"

"It's not real, but I'll try to grab it"
When you walk up in the room people staring at you
And all that we hope is that love will come around
"You gotta put in the work, it's time to make or break!"
You gotta lift up your voice and say: hallelujah anyway! Hallelujah anyway.
"And I'm up all night, howling at you"
"Holding on, we were holding on"
(Why) Are the mercies forever brand new?
I met him at the bar it was twelve or something
You give me something that I've only seen in dreams
Every path I make every road leads back
How do my blood relatives know all of these songs?
"Blind to your games, lied to my face, cut my hopes with a blade"
"And I heard him wreckin' with The Crystal Method,Name Of The Game"
Tell you that I love you when you know I've been holding it in
Never see that the things we need are staring right at us
"Drop top, I be ridin round the city in a drop top(woah woah)"
Hope that they don't think I forget about them
"Yeah, I can't promise that I'll be here till the end"

"If they hurt you, they hurtin' me"
Only be coming back when they’re turning the lights all off
How come you the best to me? I know you the worst for me
"I feel nice, like sugar and spice"
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
Take my love like it's going away
So come here and give me some kisses
Today you're nothing to me.
"Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road"
Like it's the last night of our lives (uh huh)
"Momma let me go outside, but I ain't out here tryna play"
"We can fuck for one night, ain't gotta jump the broom"
"Dwag, why you wanna do that? I don't even know"
My loyalty's sensitive so please don't cross me
"If you gon' handle it for me, then we can play"
"And I'm free, free fallin,fallin"
While all of the while the slime was under the building
"Hold onto me, it's now or it's never"
"Blind date with the chancer, we had oysters and dry lancers"
"In walks eighty long boots, looking for a date"
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
I just wanna wake up where you are
Ah baby follow with me breaking on the floor
And it's all in the things that you didn't say
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
"Why’s it gotta bother me (Why’s it gotta, why’s it gotta ya)"
Niggas banging this shit but they ain't really redd
VVSs breakin' and bustin' like the Metro (Bussin')
"Trojan attack, kidnap then we seize"
That don't have an ending cause we've been apart
"I defeat anything in my way, better move, I don't play"
The scars of your love remind me of us
"Spin on my dick like a Beyblade, uh"
"Probably not, yeah, I think I’m falling off"
Ain't nothing finer than me and my girl striking up a little lighter
Everything you've searched for is right here on the dance floor
With the tired wiry brandy look
"brit, i heard, i heard, what you gona do now?"
Girls with more than skin to show
I stood proud have you ever seen a ghetto smile?
I'll do the little things
"From crowded bars, when you were drunk"
"What’s going on with your accent there, Jared"
"Wherever we're going, gotta be prepared"
I want you around and I don’t know why
Can anybody see us while we chasing the lights
"Your movie's showin', so you're goin"
"But if you think we got problems then baby, watch Maury"""
"Lord knows we got issues, we misuse our love"
"I forget you're in bed, you're with somebody else"
"From the crystal lattice that makes up the nerves of your brain,"
And over the years though the pain was real
My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire
I'm working my way up but never raise the price
"Cause ever since I left the city, you"
Someday you wish you were a better man
"I drink the sauce,no mayo,fresh off the plane,kick it out of raw deal(Ah)"
"Gunnin' down shit, sittin' in the back of Crown Vics"
The dark room in the night will be especially bright with you
"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
"I get a little comfort, yeah, you make me feel it"
"Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough (Need your guidance)"
"Boy you know a K.I.N.G, you a peon honest to me"
"You pulled 'em for miles now, like Garbo in Berlin"
See that word just wears me out
"Getting high on my substance, we've tried it before"
"You gotta stand up tall, give them something to say,"
I'm giving you a night call to tell you how I feel
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
And on the gambrel's nails
"When I was younger, just a kid"
"Yeah, real I be, erybody know me, need no id"
"So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever"
"Huh, can't stop won't stop, where the brakes at?"
It's ten bricks in the Lear (Bricks)
I’ve been tearing up pages drifting pictures from my past
(You see the light on)
Is it better now that I'm not around
Give me your sweet talk and I will keep you up
Corridor to get some
Tryna kiss you from your feet up to your shoulders (Shoulders)
"I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me"
Do you wonder how it’d feel to
Oh shit she's here what am I supposed to Sav next
"Buzzin' like a bee, boy, don't bother me"
Because we can't live without a heart
"Baby, this is what you came for"
"Hate the other side (Side), hate the other side"
Tell them how I hope they shine
Bodies were dropping before we ever knew 'bout the truck
"I don't know where I am but it feels right, feels right"
Song so loud can’t hear my brain
Not really sure but man it feels like the first
"Kiki I can't fuck with it, I can't take you out in publi"
"Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest"
Give you something good to celebrate
I've been waiting all day for you to hit my line
But ain't nobody got a mom like mine
I'm still hanging onto everything we knew
And why I hear you say: ‘’I love you girl’’
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
We shoot his body then we lay him in that trunk nigga
And so I'm letting go and going down
I love you (LIKE I LOVE YOU)
"No, I won't hide behind the secret and the complications"
It ain't right but I'ma stay tonight because you told me so (I told you so)
I was thinking of you when I was with her last night.
"Baby, I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down"
Now honey you caught my eye from a mile away
"Don't need advice, plus you my vice, like what I like"
Stranger In a Room - Jamie xx / Oliver Simon
"Third floor on the West Side, me and you"
Now I work to bring my family stateside
You tell me get dressed we're going out this evening
Even though your thuggin’ days are gone
"Flyer than a kite, and i put that on my life"
Because it hurts to hold on
"""Sorry"" like the angel heaven let me think was you"
"But the cycle ends right now, cause you can't lead me down that road"
"Yeah I wanted it so bad that somewhere I lost you, yeah"
"Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe"
Go let out your inner animals and celebrate with me
"Could not be animal, get it, cuz when they follow I'm over they run"
Just to break me like a promise
Then I'm left to deal with how you made me
I'll drive that stake through the center of my heart
"They defend me all the time but it's useless, nah nah"
You got the puzzle pieces but you never solve 'em
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
This T-Pain song got me thinking now
I always questioned why you say the things you said.
Moment I've been feeling helpless
"No 9 to 5 (Five), but you put in work (Work)"
Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go
When he wakes up things might have changed
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Living out a life that you can't keep
Baby you'll be safe with me
"Me and Cash Carti got them sisters, 'bout to put 'em on a flight (Put 'em on a flight)"
All the popular kids at school were always super mean to me and made me cry
"It's okay, boy ive changed and I aint been here waiting "
"So give me what I want, or I'll give it to my—"
And you can have your fun 'cause I know that it’s fake
I know it's burning but I won't let go
She likes to stay late at the party cause the fun never ends
Tie the ribbon in the sky and watch it drift away
"We from two different worlds, but it's a match to me"
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
"We over, kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over"
Told myself that the only option is to change what I like (You)
Like we did when we first met
You  could  live  your  whole  life  and  I  hope  you  live  long
Because I just want to be safe and sound
I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
"I stopped and stuttered, turned around and muttered"
And if you make my poor heart break
Remind me once again why I'm repeating
But it takes the both of us to make it last
"Throw money, throw hands, throw bowls"
If I can t feel it in my chest 
But it doesn't entertain me it just hurts my head
You  don't  let  him  walk  over  your  heart
"Don't worry, be happy"
I say I'm happy but I'm still stuck on us
"God is who we pray, even though the devil's all up in my face"
You’re the star that will always shine
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
I guess whoever said the grass is greener
"Bloody noses,talking so fast like an 8-ball ain't so wrong"
Never knew what hit me when you walked into my life
"And better yet, go to times square"
Took a piece from my heart that nobody could replace
But the shake gets better with time
Cause you're right and wrong
I can take off my guard and show you my scars
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
(I won't text you when I'm drunk)
Every shade of us you fade down to keep
"But anytime you want to know, I'll be the one"
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I really really really really really really like you
"Get a bag (Get a bag), get rich (Get rich)"
Sexy love girl the things you do (Oh baby baby)
So many things that I wish you knew
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
"Tonight, I'mma fight 'til we see the sunlight"
"The reflection of one, it's everyone here but me"
He said: I wanna undress you
I must be stupid to think you take it back 
"Like wires, have a mind of their own"
I've been flexing credit scores wheil you been flexing KDA's
"Cause you walked away, and I walked away"
Feels like borderline I’m about to go insane
Is it alright if I save myself and if I clean up my own mess
"When you got with me, you were a genius"
Big bot-ty that's kickin it rippin it apart like Jason
"Drown me, in your quicksand"
I'm good as dead I know I'm staying here tonight 
"Better that you go and cut that rope, you need a bad one"
"Why don't you go, makin' it harder"
Making hits in my sleep like a heart attack (yea)
But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
Do I wanna be like Leo in that movie?
Count in right for us left to the morning light
"Diamond district in the chain, chain"
"They said I'm the new A Boogie, relax"
Give it to me only when you need it
Just one touch from your hand makes me shiver all over inside
You think you're tough but I figured you out
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
Hold up I think my phone vibratin'
"That's a nice tile floor, wish I got to know you more"
"No, I wouldn't feel the same without you somehow"
So I'ma keep her safe don't you worry 'bout it
I love you but I just need tonight off
Give it so good that you dropped who you dealin' with
But when they say that I'm only top five
My heart starts to hurt cause you're all I got
"This is my year, man, if you couldn't tell"
Boy can we agree?
All we can give is a part of us that feels incomplete
No one there to catch you in their arms
"I like my women like I like my money, green"
"Man, and now my lifestyle's changed"
You won't need to close your eyes when I hold you in my wings
"You look me in the eyes, say that we will stay for life"
"I never start a fight, I man up every time"
"It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah"
"And while I introduce you at the party, you say it's up there"
I whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out
In places we won't walk
I'm really hurting now that your gone
And my nine is easy to load
I could do you so wrong and be right still
Yeah  I bet you're bending God's ear talking about me
"But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, ""Things were finally going well for him."""
"The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said."
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.

"A spokesperson for Sons  Daughters said they were ""shocked and devastated"" by his death."
"""We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed,"" the spokesperson said."

Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
"In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained ""persistently silent"" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected."
"She said: ""In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."""
"In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September."
"The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS."
"The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended."
"He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students."
"Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England."
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
"But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most."
"There was the handshake, yes."
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
"Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his ""dear friend"" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report."
I lost count.
"He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher."
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
"To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite."
But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.
"In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border."
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
"Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back."
"The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend."
"Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible."
Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
"For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara."
"All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything."
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's denied that emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.
"After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan."
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
"First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup."
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic motive.
"Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
"As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume."
They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
"And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again."
"""Tourists that way, tomatoes back here,"" as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it."
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
"Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change."
"So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an ""alliance of misfits"": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces."
"Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences."
"The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides."
"It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic."
"Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them."
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
"The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive."
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
"During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands."
"It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray."
"But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore."
"Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised."
"In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest."
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
"There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam  Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank."
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
"He told BBC Scotland: ""The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."""
"As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand."
"I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations."
"Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands."
"RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship."
"""The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?"" said the chief executive."
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
"But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change."
"We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right."
"Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection"
"Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins"
"Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday."
"He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden."
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
"He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson."
"Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: ""It's special."""
I'm very emotional because my family are here as well
I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
"It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people."
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
"Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career."
"Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins"
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
"He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room."
"He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years."
"I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!"
"Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see."
"He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
"From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades."
It has been a rollercoaster ride.
"Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban."
"Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best."
"And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least."
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
"A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had ""decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration,"" but gave no reason."
"Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor."
"Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."
"Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy."
"Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian)."
"On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: ""Thank you for your trust."""
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.
"Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him."
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
"Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB."
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
"But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections."
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
No-one knows yet.
"But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism."
"In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said ""it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years."
"Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months."
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
"He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin."
"In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy."
"When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most."
"It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional."
"But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev."
"Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later."
Mystery as fish land in Banff garden
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.
"Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish."
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
"It is the first of four closures between the ""deck fans,"" which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers."
"The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes."
"It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables."
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.
"He said: ""This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing."
"We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge."
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.
"Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge."
"Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: ""The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone."
"On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering."
"After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side."
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
"This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation."
"Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%."
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
"Happily, it all went very well."
Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
Effortless on beam.
Jaw-dropping on floor.
Brilliant all over.
"And now, finally, an Olympic champion."
"The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight."
"Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and ""Final Five"" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina."
"United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday."
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
"Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her ""the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."""
"One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations."
"Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment."
"United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug."
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.
"While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true."
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
"She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to."
"Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage."
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.
"Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality."
"Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker."
"This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call ""grandma"" was well ahead."
"She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt."
"As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:"
"Mahaj Brown, 6, ""riddled with bullets,"" survives Philadelphia shooting"
"Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week."
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
"The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital."
"""He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets,"" his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station."
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
"One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia."
"The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports."
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
"Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene."
It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
"There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk."
"So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged,"" Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station."
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
"Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood."
"She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect."
"Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"
That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.
"First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant."
"And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren ""Laurie"" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color."
"The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud."
"This team looks, finally, like America."
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
"For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American."
"Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2."
This is powerful.
"Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered."
"Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines."
"On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event."
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
"We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country."
"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team."
"They are the ""Final Five"" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching."
"But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on."
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
"These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families."
"Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics."
"We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie."
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
"At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions."
"In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."
"Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."
"This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work."
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.
"To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls."
This is such an exciting time.
"Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of ""Girl Power"" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women."
Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
"Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it."
"In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in ""no man's land"" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients."
"The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours."
"Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors"" committee chair, said in a statement last night: ""Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."""
"With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out."
"Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government."
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
"""Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors"" concerns."
If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
"The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line."
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
"The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract."
"Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes."
"Mr Mortimer said: ""Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."""
"Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing."
"Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May."
The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
"Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer."
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
"The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack."
"NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems."
"But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems."
"Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke."
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
"If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack."
"And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke."
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.
"Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely."
"The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years."
"Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: ""Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."""
Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
"The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack."
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
"Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period."
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
"Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report"
"A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today."
"Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of ""over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."""
"The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters."
He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.
"Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address."
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
"Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says."
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"""This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,"" he said."
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
"Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices."
"The court found Rahman ""cynically perverted"" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia."
"Rahman, it was said, ""ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."""
"Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else."
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are"
"His report says: ""Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background."
"""There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of ""politically correct"" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."""
"Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop ""vote harvesting."""
"The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud."
Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
"Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is ""astonishing"" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case."
"""The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices,"" he said."
He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.
"He also criticises the ineffectual ""tick-box inspections"" of town hall electoral registration departments."
"Sir Eric said: ""Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call."
"Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation."
Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
"Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge."
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.
"So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs."
"The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid"
"Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio."
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
"And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid."
"'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post."
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
"Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan."
"And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now."
Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.
"Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'"
"Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes"
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
"Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks"
One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'
"Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes."
"Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union."
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
"MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'."
"Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig."
Thanks for that.
"Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China."
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
"Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, ""Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'""????"
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
"Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'"
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
"Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald."
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
"Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'"
"It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'"
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
"Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf"
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
"We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air."
We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.
"To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual."
"That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said."
"On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack."
"'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'"
"'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'"
"'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'"
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.
"To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf."
"She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone."
"The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf"
"A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'"
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
"Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on."
"'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'"
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'
"Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'"
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'
"'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'"
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'
All the product in question has been removed from sale.
How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
"It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you."
"We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range."
"Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger."
"If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'."
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
"A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him."
"For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire."
"At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him."
Sounds tricky?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.
"Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction"
"A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours."
"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them."
"After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair."
"The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls."
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
"Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving."
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
"The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing."
"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June."
"Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished"
"Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past"
Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
"'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'"
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
"Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority."
"The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property"
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.
"I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information."
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
"In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash."
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
"She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013."
"After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth."
The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
"Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules."
"'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said."
"Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities."
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
"Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland ""with some degree of credibility."""
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
"He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to ""rock the boat"" with a new pick."
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
"Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are ""minions"" and ""enablers"" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump."
He said Trump is unfit for office.

French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.
"At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants."
"The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks."
"Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp."
They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
"A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns ""were totally understandable."""
"The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that ""live in extremely precarious conditions."""
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
"One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids"" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp."
"More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids"" cafe."
"A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure ""would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."""
"Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer."
"""This 5,000-yuan subsidy solved the problem of my pressing need for money."""

"On August 9, when she was worried about the tuition, the county committee of the Communist Youth League timely offered her a 5,000-yuan subsidy."
"Recently, the related county government department has provided a subsidy totaled RMB 2.838 million to over 690 poverty-stricken college students."
"Meanwhile, it has organized social fund-raising for students who are extremely poor in financial status to help them complete their studies."
"This year, Huayuan County collected more than RMB 18.5 million of educational funds and self-raised more than RMB 2.5 million, which will be injected into the real-name bank accounts of the corresponding students."
"""I thought my elder brother and I cannot attend college after my father passed away. Unexpectedly, the county government offered us subsidies so timely."" She said gratefully."
"As of August 8, Huayuan County had raised more than RMB 21 million for 13,140 poverty-stricken students from various relief funds this first half year."

"Therefore, the problems of high pollution, heavy energy consumption and high-ratio land occupation have not been fundamentally addressed in the transformation of production and life styles."
"On the one hand, Jiangsu tops in the whole country from the perspective of ecological environment construction achievement of all levels and classes. But on the other hand, the resource and environment bearing pressure is heavy."

More than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate. More than 20 Hu-Tong industry docking projects worth at least RMB 100 million saw on-site contract signing."

Qingdao is China's 12th and also Shandong province's first city to pilot paid use and trade the emission right.
"On the 11th day of the month, many companies came to the Qingdao Municipal Emission right Center to submit emission right applications. After acceptance, they shall pay fees for the paid use."
The upcoming first transaction also indicates that Qingdao's emission right trading pilot work officially kicked off. It will also be the first emission right trading deal in Shandong and the first city-level emission right trading in China.
"On the morning of the 11th day of the month, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Double Peach Specialty Chemicals (Group) Co., Ltd., came to the trading center to submit the emission right subscription."
Its plant in the old urban area of Qingdao came to a full halt and was moved to the new plant in Pingdu due to environmental reason.
"After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form and the construction project environmental impact report, etc., the Qingdao Municipal Emission Right Reserve and Trading Service Center began to review the application materials."
"According to the collection standard determined by Qingdao's price bureau and financial sector, the estimated initial emission right fee is about RMB 641,200. The working staff will finish review within 7 working days."
The upcoming completion of the first transaction also indicates that Qingdao emission right trading pilot work will officially kick off. It will also be the first emission right trading in Shandong and the first city-level emission right trading in China.
"According to Zhao Xiuping, the company has now invested up to RMB 400 million in environmental protection. Thought it seems to be a big sum, it has a great impact on the enterprise management philosophy and social benefits and also opened up room for enterprise innovation management."
"On the same day, Qingdao SF-XC-ZZ Coach Component Co., Ltd. also came to apply for emission rights for its high-speed rail and CRH interior accessory project with an annual output of 4,200 pieces."
"The project is a mechanical processing enterprise. Its initial emission rights for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) are 0.514 tons/year and 0.052 tons/year, respectively."
The paid use and trading of air pollutant emission right cover the city's key industrial enterprises for the production and supply of electricity and heat.
"The current pollutant discharging units which had obtained environmental impact assessment as of January 1, 2016, will be exempt from fees for paid use."
"""The obtaining of paid use of emission rights is not equal to the obtaining of the right for illegal discharge, so companies cannot discharge pollutants at will."""
"Companies of illegal and excessive sewage must be punished in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations, according to Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau. It is impossible to allow enterprises to circumvent punishments via purchasing emission rights."
"In other words, we need to crack down on environmental violations through legal means and severely punish the enterprises' over standard discharge behaviors, so as to protect the environment and public health."
"Now for their own interests, enterprises have shown higher enthusiasm in pollution control, cherished limited emission rights and reduced emissions of pollutants."
"With the economic interests drive, to reduce pollutants' discharge has shifted from the government's mandatory behavior into a conscious market behavior, so as to truly protect the environment, nature and public health."
"Emission right, also known as ""dumping right"", means the right to discharge pollutants. It refers to the right for emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment in line with the law within the quota assigned by the government."
"This right is essentially the right of the emitters to occupy, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources."
"In the next step, under the premise that the total discharge of pollutants does not exceed the total allowable emission volume, discharge capacities of the internal resources of pollution will be able to be swapped via currency exchange."
The emission right trading concept was put forward by American economist Dyers in 1968 and began to be adopted by the United States for the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources in the 1970s.

"According to the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in order to assist the air attack of the six strategic bombers on the ""Islamic State"" target in Syria, a number of Russian fighters took off from the Hmeimin air base in Syria to provide support."
"On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement on the Syrian conflict. The ceasefire agreement will be implemented since February 27."
"Under the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations including ""Islamic State"" and ""Salvation Front"", which were identified by the United Nation Security Council."
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure in the base and the living conditions of the Russian soldiers will be protected correspondingly.
"If the extremist forces were not hit, these forces will be extended to Russia, he added."
"Although Russia and the West did not reach an agreement on the cooperation against the extremist forces of Syria, Russia would strengthen cooperation with parties like Syria, Iran and Iraq in this regard."
"In September 2015, Russia, at the invitation of the Syrian government, began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces."

"The traffic control department of Songjiang District, Shanghai, recently used electronic police to monitor whether drivers play mobile phone while driving. As a result, more than 30 cases were detected in a week."
"With the popularity of smart phones, mobile phones become more and more interesting. WeChat chatting, microblogging, playing games and even shopping on Taobao have become normal. It seems that many people cannot do without the phone for a moment, and cannot stop doing so even when driving."
"According to the Road Traffic Safety Law, mobile phones playing is banned and defined as one of the ""behaviors threating driving safety""."
"Unfortunately, due to some reasons such as the large number of illegal cases and difficulty in obtaining evidence, those people have never been punished and make the law become a kind of decoration."
"If the traffic control department can determine to declare war to the mobile phone playing behavior during driving and normalize such measures, such illegal behaviors will surely be curbed."

"Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: ""handsome hands"" encourage her to embark on shooting career, which saw several ""reverses"""
"Zhang Donghong, a villager of East Park Village, Xiang'an District, Xiamen, changed an old 29-inch TV into a new 65-inch large TV just a few days before."
"The ordinary farmer has a daughter named Zhang Binbin, who is the one to win the three-posture final silver medal of the Olympic Games Women's 50-meters rifle game for China on the evening of the 11th day of the month."
"Just then and just in front of this new TV set, the Zhang Donghong couple and their dozens of relatives and friends were witnessing the magic process for the couple's daughter to catch up and reverse from almost being eliminated in the preliminaries to almost winning the game."
"During the competition of the that day, Zhang Binbin once ranked in the lower intermediate level and it seemed that she was still quite far away from the final."
"But her parents and friends did not give up, kept watching the live broadcast and saw that as other players finish the game, Zhang Binbin raised her rank all the way and finally came to the final. At this time, a burst of cheers took place in her home."
"In the final, Zhang Binbin also started from lagging behind and shot more stably and won the silver medal with just 0.2 rings behind the champion."
"Actually, the 27-year-old Zhang Binbin has almost missed the hard-won silver medal for several times in the 16-year shooting career."
"According to her mother Zhang Xiaolong, Zhang Binbin brought a few ""persuaders"" from her village when they were hesitating."
"These persuaders were girls and boys of her village who were recommended to attend the training at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's elder female cousin."
"However, shortly after coming to the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again took the initiative to return to a Xiang'an school to continue her study because of her family difficulties."
"But after repeated efforts of her enlightening teacher, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team."
"And after she came into the provincial team, Zhang Binbin returned home again because she found it almost hopeless to enter the national team after a long time."
"This time, not only the coach Zhang Yajie, but also the leaders and coaches of the Xiamen shooting archery sports center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home. With their efforts, Zhang Binbin was finally persuaded to return to the provincial team."
"Just like yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl achieved several reversals on her shooting way with her insistence."
"""Each coach has his own method to choose players. I decided to take her once I saw her beautiful hands."""
"Zhang Donghong also recalled that in the training test, although the results of her daughter were not the best, they were very stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches."
"During the training process of Zhang Binbin, it was the input of this farmer girl that impressed Zhang Yajie most."
"He recalled that more than a year after Zhang Binbin came into the Xiamen shooting team, the team carried out a long-time gun-holding training for standing shooting, requiring players to stand still for half an hour."
"Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child, with the hobbies of painting and making toys."
"""I used to make clothes and do some needlework while Binbin picked up some scraps to make her own dolls."""
"My daughter often made toys by sewing, said her mother. Plus, she is good at painting and could make everything animated, from the doll's facial features to clothing."
"As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and her family are more often separated than being together. As she can only return home during festivities, she mainly contacts her family by phone at ordinary times."
"Zhang Binbin seldom complained of her hard work but talked more with her parents about some good things, according to her parents."
"Since they cannot often see their daughter, they carefully keep her paintings finished in her childhood and honors received in the past."
"Zhang Xiaolong showed her daughter's cartoon drawings to the journalist, ""Had she not become a shooter, she should keep drawing."""
"In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there was a cupboard filled with medals and certificates."
"Zhang Donghong put away the medals neatly and placed all certificates into files for storage. ""These are honors obtained by Binbin after over ten years' efforts. We cherished them."""

"According to a Hong Kong Oriental Daily report made on August 12, the current diamond sales in mainland China were accused of three major problems, including false diamond clarity mark aimed to raise sales price, false diamond weight and lack of aftersales warranty."
"Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers. The diamond cutting technology of local artisans is well-known. All diamonds on sale have undergone rigorous identification, deeply welcomed by the mainland ladies."
"""A small cloth bag with a handful of diamonds, which is very light and can be held in a hand, is worth of almost one million yuan"", a woman surnamed Liu who participated in the purchase of diamonds told her experience in Antwerp last June to the mainland media."
"She hid the diamonds in her lingerie and carried them all day along, including when she went to toilet and took bath. She felt quite nervous in both walking and sleeping."
"She said the diamond she bought in Antwerp was priced at about RMB 55,000 per gram and diamond of the same quality was priced by retailers at about RMB 111,000 in Xia'men."
"Recently, she sold the diamond at a 20% price premium and earned two hundred thousand yuan at a time."
"According to the provisions of the mainland China customs, diamonds are neither supplies nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods. So such diamonds should be declared at entry and exit. Otherwise, the people who carry them shall be classified as smuggling and may be sentenced to jail."
"According to foreign media reports, on the 10th day of the month of the local time, Downing Street announced that United Kingdom Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend her summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place."
"According to some media, after the United Kingdom referendum about exit from the European Union, the new United Kingdom Prime Minister chose to spend her vacation in the ""neutral country"" on the European continent, Switzerland. This is symbolic."
"The symbolic neutrality nature of the Switzerland affected the choice of the United Kingdom Prime Minister's first resort, according to the United Kingdom ""Guardian""."
"Teresa Mei chose to take a vacation in Switzerland. This is the first time that a United Kingdom prime minister chose to go vacation in Switzerland after Margaret Thatcher, according to the United Kingdom newspaper Daily Telegraph."
The choice of these two female prime ministers is quite a contrast to the vacation selection of hotter places by Blair and Cameron
It is reported that the new United Kingdom Prime Minister Teresa Mei will return to Rondon on August 24. A series of important work and activities will be waiting for her.
The United Kingdom parliament will resume on September 5. The subject matter covers the second Brexit referendum required on the internet.

China's Mars program kicks off
"China's Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling at one time, which has never done by other countries."
"China's Mars exploration launch target is to step around, land and patrol at one time. Such a task is quite arduous."
"Because there is only one time window for the Mars probe in every 26 months, experts are closely working on the project plan and try to launch the first Mars probe in 2020."
"Although China's aircraft has entered a deep space, it is still essential to finish the task of Mars exploration, which marks that China has stepped into the deep space exploration era in a true sense, according to Xu Dazhe."
"""Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most energy efficient to launch the vehicle."""
"""Considering the mass of Mars detectors, it is the mission for China's Long March 5 carrier rocket to complete the launch mission."""
"China's Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling in one mission, which has never occurred in other countries. They once achieved surrounding and landing before in other countries, but failed at landing."
"Mars exploration involves a lot of technical areas. In particular, although the rover is a space detector, it has a distinctive feature compared with the general space detector."
"In other words, the Mars probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the ability to find obstacles."
"According to Pang Zhihao, a researcher of the fifth institute of China's Aerospace Science and Technology Group, the reason for human being to favor Mars exploration is that Mars detection has significant scientific and technical meanings and it even matters to the future of human beings."
"Currently, the Mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration."
"Therefore, the human beings hope to establish a base of residence on the Mars one day, and immigrate to Mars, thereby turning it into a second home for mankind."
"A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth in the past. It took billions of years of evolution to change into the current state of thin atmosphere, low temperature and water depletion, etc."
"Therefore, the detection or manned landing on the Mars for research can help propose a pre-arranged planning of preventing Earth from becoming the second Mars."
"As of June 2016, the world conducted a total of 114 lunar explorations, including 43 Mars detection missions."
"However, ever since the 1990s, a total of 18 human explorations have been carried out and only 14 lunar detections have been conducted."
"There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers at work, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are at work."
World space powers have developed a detection plan with the Mars system as target. So we can see the current Mars detection is hotter than that of moon detection.
"On Nov. 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars probe ""Mangalian"". Then it became Asia's first country for successful detection of the Mars."
"""Mangalian"" is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of the Mars and explore whether there are signs of methane and life on the Mars."
The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the Martian atmosphere for aerodynamic configuration and parachute deceleration.
"According to Sun Zezhou, the chief designer of a Mars detector of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Mars exploration task is confronted with many technical challenges."
"The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of that of the Earth, with high uncertainty."
"Scientists have not had a thorough understanding of Mars factors, such as its changes and storm characteristics."
"A dust storm similar to the Earth's dust is often formed in the Mars in the summer, which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy. So a ""sleep"" mode must be designed for the Mars rover so that it can wait patiently until the departure of dust storms."
"At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the energy supply for Mars detection."
This requires that the detector's sun wing area to be larger and constantly adjust so as to align with the sun direction.
"In addition, since the gravity of the Mars is only 38% of that of the earth and much higher than that of the Moon surface, so the probe requires higher power."
"""The core and the most difficult part of the Mars exploration mission are the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration process after the probe enters Martian atmosphere. There is just one chance to ensure success."""
"According to Sun Zezhou, it must rely on the detector to complete the entire process because the distance between the Earth and the Mars is quite large."
"Because there is not so much propellant to offset the high speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing on the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth."
"The way to detect the Mars is similar to the way to detect the moon in general. The entire process is also ""surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning"" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars, according to Pang Zhihao."
"Because the distance between the Mars and the earth is larger than that between the Moon and the Earth, it needs to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties for Mars exploration."
"According to Taiwanese media reports, Lin Quan, the head of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, announced yesterday morning, ""Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations by political parties and their accompanying organizations"" will take effective since today."
"KMT Vice Chairman Zhan Qixian said, ""Kuomintang, with a hundred years of history, will step down otherwise without social commitment and responsibility."""
"Lin Quan stressed that if the political party, accompanying organization or trustees are in violations of the regulations which prohibit provisions ban, the Commission will investigate and punish ""according to the law""."
"Lin Quan also announced that Hong Peigen, ""Deputy Director of the Independent Commission against Corruption"", will serve as the vice chairman of the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee."
He said that Gu Lixiong will be the most appropriate candidate for the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations. The experience of Hong Peigen who dealt with the major cases will serve as the foundation for the committee to uncover the related ill-gotten party assets.
"As long as there are party assets today, no one will give you social donations, according to Zhan Qixian. So if the party assets were all confiscated, then Kuomintang can ask for social support and sponsorship. ""You will have a chance to go when there are really no assets now."""
"Zhan Qixian also stressed that even if the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations goes into effect and the Kuomintang party assets are not fully confiscated, the rest will continue to be confiscated as promised, the party asset will go null and the party will start from scratch."
"Original title: Lawsuit Launched by ""Corridor Doctor"" Lan Yuefeng against CCTV Host Wang Zhi'an for Reputation Infringement Fails in First Instance"
"According to the Legal Evening News: Because the CCTV host Wang Zhi'an published his remarks against the ""corridor doctor"" event on microblogging, Lan Yuefeng brought Wang Zhi'an and Beijing Micro Dream Chuangke Network Technology Co., Ltd. to the court."
"Yesterday afternoon, Haidian court ruled the case. According to the verdict, Wang Zhi'an and Micro Dream Company did not constitute the infringement and dismissed the Lan Yuefeng for all the claims."
"At the beginning of 2014, Wang Zhi'an, a reporter of CCTV found after his survey that although the Lan Yuefeng event (sitting in the corridor for more than 600 days) was shaped as the tragic hero suppressed by the media, these reports had a lot of false information."
"On March 29, 2014, the ""Corridor Doctor"" program produced by CCTV news survey went live."
All information about the so-called excessive medical treatment reported by Lan Yuefeng to the media do not have any evidence support.
"In the microblogging with real-name certification, Wang Zhi'an also said that the reason for Lan Yuefeng to become this is his stubborn characters and paranoid personality""."
"Lan Yuefeng claimed that Wang Zhi'an should delete the microblogging posts, apologize to him and pay RMB 100,000 as the mental damage solatium."
"In the court hearing, the two sides argued whether Wang Zhian violated the reputation right of Lan Yuefeng."
"Highlight of the 12th day of the month: at the beginning of Track and Field Events, the Chinese team is quite busy and the women's football association aims to become the top four of the bicycle games"
"The bicycle game is expected to realize ""a breakthrough to the zero gold medal record"" in the Olympic Games while the Women's World Cup girls will challenge Germany team, the world champion winner for twice and are expected to become the top four."
Wang Zhen was quite outstanding in the recent two races. He won a silver medal for the athletics world championship held in Beijing last year and was upgraded to the individual project champion in the world championship this May.
"According to foreign media reports, Zhang Huizhen, a 27-year-old Korean archery female player, won the gold medal in the women's archery individual tournament. This is her second Olympic gold medal following the one for team competition. This made her a double winner."
"Zhang Huizhen is considered as a late bloomer. She regrets not winning the last session of the Rondon Olympic Games tickets before, but now she proudly stands on the top of the Rio Olympic podium."
"Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in Lisa Wenglu, a total score of 6-2 in the women's archery finals at the Samba Boulevard in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."
She did archery for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school. She did not win the first individual tournament gold medal until she was 27 in 2014. So she is a late bloomer.
"Zhang Huizhen recalled, ""My performance before high school was too bad to enable me to participate in the national competition."
"Zhang Huizhen was only ranked the fourth at the Rondon Olympic Games qualification trials. Unfortunately, she lost the Olympic admission and just watched her colleague and good friend Qi Fubei win two gold medals."
"Zhang Huizhen talked about his gold winning after the women's individual awards ceremony of archery. ""I tried to shoot one by one until the last. Maybe it is because this brings me good results and makes me contented."""
"Qi Fubei, the 28-year-old Korean archery ""No.1"", and the Rondon Olympic Games archery individual tournament winner, won the bronze medal."
Qi Fubei was defeated by Zhang Huizhen in the semifinals and competed for the bronze medal with the Mexican player Alexandra Valencia.
"Qi Fubei shed tears after she knew she won the bronze medal, from which we can see her pressure."
"Firstly, the coaching staff accumulated rich experience in his gradual study. Secondly, it needs scientific training, which should be accumulated over time."
The archery team helped the team players focus and remain unbiased via military training and going through a cemetery during night.
"Although not yet confirmed, it is said by many sources that Apple's 2016 autumn conference will be held in September, and iPhone7 would really hit the market."
"Despite no response from Apple, there are news release about the function and configuration of the new iPhone. There are even the images of iPhone7 ""real machine prototype"" on the internet."
"The new generation of iPhone is really ""eye-catching"", hot and hard-to-get. If you want to buy the genuine at the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning."
"This has further dampened people's enthusiasm for the new iPhone. ""It is lengthened, but cannot be used to cast holographic images! This generation is so terrible."""
"iPhone7, just like other iPhones, carries countless secrets before birth."
"In addition, there are a number of sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will have the 3.5mm headphone jack cancelled, and adopt Bluetooth connection and charging interface instead, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker."
"Another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple will allow headset manufacturers to produce headset products via producing charging interface."
Another evidence to confirm this message is that Apple allows the headphone manufacturer to produce headphone via the connection of charge interface.
Whether these news are true or false will not be unveiled until the 2016 Apple autumn news conference.
"But this does not prevent the industry insiders from being optimistic about the prospects of iPhone7 - many people think that iPhone7 will be likely to become the last major upgrade of Apple's iPhone series, although it can be seen from the data released by the market research institution IDC that the market share of iPhone will decline to some degree."
"Among them, Goldman Sachs ranked Apple's stock to be the rating of ""buying"" while BMO analyst thought that iPhone7 will achieve a historical high sales."
"Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth will likely be more than 20%, which is entirely due to the introduction of iPhone7."
"7% of respondents expected to buy iPhone7, while the rate for iPhone6 was only 4% two years ago."
It is learned that currently 20% of user groups of iPhone6 or 6Plus have such a plan to purchase iPhone7. This is a rather high proportion.
"Secondly, according to expert analysis, most of the iPhone fans like to replace their own iPhones every two generations."
"According to statistics, among all iPhone users, about 26% of users have not changed their phones for two years. That is, almost 120 million users of iPhones have been using the same iPhone for two years."
"According to media, Taiwan witnessed several earthquakes during the production period of iPhone7. ""The destruction of TSMC production facilities is beyond imagination and may impact the initial supply of iPhone7."""
"Balance between supply and demand will affect the average users, so it is time to choose a good channel and purchase the genuine iPhone7 for the first time."
"According to informed sources, recently, Suning executives and Apple frequently meet, with the purpose to prepare adequate supply."
"Operators have negotiated with Suning. So it is foreseeable that, with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, lower prices and more intimate services will surely be brought to users."
"""With the lowest price, the consumer may ""buy iPhone7 with just 7 yuan per day""."
Adequate supply and a variety of concessions will alleviate the pressure of iPhone7 buying. Suning's logistics will change such good feeling into more intuitive sense of experience.
"Maybe you'll get a call at midnight. ""Hello. This is from Suning Tesco. We are calling to say your iPhone7 is here."""

"According to foreign media reports, the ""green pool"" incident of Rio Olympic Games gained much attention because its diving pool water was changed from blue to green."
"However, on the morning of the 10th day of the month, the water of the water polo match adjacent to the water pool also turned green."
An Australian water polo contestant said that he felt tingling in eyes and would like to shed tears.
"Previously, officials of the Rio Olympic Games confirmed the greening of water and said the water color was due to weaker alkalinity and will not affect the athlete's health."
"But according to an Australian athlete, after winning the games with its Japanese counterpart, he felt tingling in eyes and wanted to shed tears after the games."
"When the water of diving pool turned green first, the hosting party worked overtime to deal with the diving pool problems on the evening of the 9th day of the month and found the rapid change of water polo pool on the morning of the 10th day of the month."
"During the competition period of the Australian and Japanese teams, the environmental conditions of the water polo pond gradually worsened, but the official stressed that they would manage to restore the water quality of the two pools to their original on the 11th day of the month."
"""The alkalinity of water in the diving pool firstly turned weak after the yesterday afternoon,"" said Mario Andrada, the spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games."
"""We learned about a series of causes that may trigger the discoloration of water and result in the alkalinity of water quality."""
"The water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the swimming pool to determine whether the water quality meets criteria. """
"""We have been following the normal procedure these days, but we may have overlooked the impact of more athletes on water quality."""
"""But the change in water color certainly has no effect on health, especially for athletes."""
"""This independent team confirms our assessment and also acknowledged the measures we have taken to restore the normal color and normal chemical status of the pool."""
"""We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain."""

Urumqi Normalizes Operating Order of Independent Traveler Tourism Market and Says that Travel Agencies Must Sign Contracts with Tourists
"Currently, Xinjiang has entered peak tourist season. In order to regulate the management order of tourism FIT market, Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment worked with the law enforcement detachment of the Urumqi transportation authority yesterday to investigate and deal with the non-normative travel vehicles existent in the tourism FIT market, and the low contract signing between the travel agency and tourists."
"At 8 O'clock of yesterday morning, around 10 buses packed with tourists parked around the Kempinski Hotel. These vehicles are mostly used by individual group that went for Tianchi for one-day tour."
"""Hello, I am from the Urumqi City Tourism Bureau. Did you sign a contract with the travel agency?"""
"Yu Bin, the working staff of law enforcement detachment of the Urumqi Transportation Authority explained, ""The foreign tourist bus and bus line worked on tourist transport project in Urumqi market, but they did not have qualification."""

"On the morning of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016."
"Sheng Laiyun, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and head of the National Economic Statistics Division, said that, in July, some of indexes of the national economy slowed relatively but were still in the reasonable range."
"According to the data of National Bureau of Statistics, the fixed asset investment growth, total imports and other data in July came down."
"As for the national economy in July, I would like to use the words of the Premier, ""the shape is volatile and the potential is still good"", said Sheng Laiyun. This is a better way to summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July."
"He explained that ""the shape is volatile"" refers to the fall of growth rate of some economic indicators in July."
"In July, as the domestic and international economy still in the deep adjustment, the international situation is complex and ever changing and the world economic recovery failed to meet expectations, the export pressure remained heavy."
"As for the domestic situation, the whole economy is still in the critical stage and is suffering pains of adjustment and the economy is under great downward pressure, some indicators were still fluctuating."
"There was a special case in July, when serious floods, high temperature and hot weather brought some impact on the production and operation of some areas, according to Sheng Laiyun."
"According to the recent report of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people were affected, with direct economic losses of more than RMB 200 billion."
"From the view of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees."
The cargo turnover growth rate in July fell 3.6 percentages month on month and floods in these areas had a certain impact on traffic.
"In view of these factors, it is quite normal and predictable to have some fluctuations in some indicators in July."
"He said, ""The potential is still good"" means that despite the fallback of economic growth, the overall economic performance is stable and steady. And the good momentum has not changed."
"In July, the CPI rose by 1.8%, with a month-on-month rise of 0.2%. From January to July, The CPI rose by 2.1%, so the overall price situation was stable."
"According to the statistics of hot weather in the districts and counties by the portal of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Meteorology, in addition to Youyang, people in the rest of the city can receive different amounts of high temperature subsidy."
"At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standards of the allowance, but the standards issued by provinces and municipalities are not the same, and people in Chongqing receive the allowance according to the standard of high-temperature working days."
"In case of temperature between 35 and 37℃, people can receive allowance of no less than 10 yuan per day. In case of temperature above 37℃, people can receive allowances of no less than 15 yuan per day."
"In case of temperature above 40℃, staff working in high temperature can receive up to 20 yuan per day of allowance (but for laborers who enjoy the high temperature job allowance)."
"In accordance with this standard, people in Kaizhou which has the largest number of high temperature days can receive 330 yuan last month. And people in Chengkou with the least days of high temperature can receive 80 yuan. And because the maximum temperature of Youyang did not meet the high temperature standards, there is no high temperature allowance."
"In the past, many companies adopt cool drinks as high temperature allowance. The city safety supervision bureau deemed that this behavior does not meet the current regulation."
Employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of workers in case of terminating work and reducing working hours in high temperature weather.
"The city's Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said that if employees did not receive high temperature allowance while working under high temperature, they may fight for the legitimate rights and interests via the labor dispute mediation organization or dial 12333 for complaint."
"If the employer refuses to pay the high temperature allowance, the laborer may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources social security at the county level or above."
"At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage and not welfare, such an allowance shall be included in the total wages, with tax deducted."
"So the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage, it must be issued in cash and not substituted by physical objects such as drinks."
"The newly-built Urumqi station is located in Urumqi high-speed rail area, with the whole construction area of around 100,000 square meters."
"The layer 1 and 2 are for entrance, waiting room and office, commercial use while the layer -1 is for exit."

"Gracia is a cute female toucan, exuding the breath of tropical rain forest."
"In Costa Rica, one of the Central American countries, Toucan Gracia and its story have long been known."
"At the press conference on August 10, after postoperative rehabilitation, Gresham finally appeared and showed people its brand new 3D printing plastic beak."
"This toucan, which had its beak broken and was dying just one year and a half ago, finally regained its new life."
"This day not only announced that it has restored health by 100%, but also signaled its move into the luxury aviary to meet its human friends."
"The newcomer Grecia was slightly shy initially, but soon became lively, rolling in the basin frolic and eating grapes with a new beak."
"In order to remind people of its damage it once suffered from, the technical staff did not give it a new beak color, but retained the original white color of the 3D print material."
"The beak is a thin layer of horny sheath, which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bones to support."
"Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt."
"An animal rescue center, ornithologists and a US 3D printing company worked together to prepare several ""test beaks"" for Gracia and finally built a ""perfect beak"" for it."
"Now Gracia can use the new beak to drink water, eat things, and even peck tiny grains."
"""The design of the finished product costs about two months and it just takes 4-5 hours to print it."""
"""3D printing is not a future technology but indeed becoming part of your life,"" said Thomas Lange, chairman of SG3D, a US printing company, in an interview by Xinhua International journalists."
"In January 2015, Gracia, lying on a farm in the town of Alajuela in the middle of Costa Rica, was found with blood covering on its body."
"At that time, its beak was cruelly broken by a group of young people. It was completely unable to eat and dying."
"After the tragedy of the Gracia was reported by the media, there is a wave of animal anti-abuse calls inside and outside Costa Rica."
People demand to establish more rigorous animal protection laws to enhance the punishment against abusers.
People came spontaneously to try their utmost to help Gracia restore its life before hurting.
"Even the inventor of the 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, was also involved in the design of the Gracia beak."
"""The situation of Gracia is very special, and its residual beak is less than 1 centimeter long, so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak."""
"""We first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis, which is slightly longer than the rest of the upper part of its beak, and fixed it on its beak with glue."""
"""This can reduce the risk of further intrusive damage to Gracia,"" Lange told journalists of Xinhua International."
"Before installing the prosthesis, the staff cleared the broken beak of Gracia every day to prevent infection."
"Thousands of miles away, the story of the Toucan Gracia touched the famous documentary director Paula El Reidia and the news channel producer John Hoffman."
"They recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new beak, and recorded a documentary ""The Country of Toucan"", which was played this month on the Animal Planet Channel."
"The documentary ""The State of the Toucan"" shows people how a small Toucan has changed a country and how people get involved in the fight against the torture of animals."
"Core Tip: Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of small independent Chinese oil refineries, especially those that are called ""teapots""."
"Japan's largest oil company JX Energy believes that ""China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn."" the Cankaoxiaoxi website reported on August 12."
"Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of small independent Chinese oil refineries, especially those that are called ""teapots""."
The quality of China's oil products is gradually close to those of their Japanese counterparts because the Chinese government has strengthened environmental protection regulations.
"Before obtaining the import license for crude oil, ""teapot refineries"" generally refine oil from the heavy oil, which has high sulfur content and is imported from Russia."
"The petroleum products are poor in quality due to high sulfur content, which has become one of the causes of environmental pollution."
"After obtaining crude oil import license, ""teapot refineries"" can import Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil, which have low sulfur contents and have improved the quality of the petroleum products."
""" China's domestic oil product quality standards continued to improve and the refining capacity of the refining equipment also increased."
"As a result, the quality of oil products exported from China gradually reached the same level as that of Japan (the world's highest quality),"" said TonenGeneral Sekiyu."
"""After the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia,"" according to JX Energy. Such light oil products are competitive with Japanese products on the Asian market."
"Although the ""Japanese high quality oil"" falls into a crisis, the Japanese oil companies just adopted the strategy of ""exporting to profitable areas while being concerned about the market""."
"As China's exports of petroleum products have a huge impact on the Asian market, teapot refineries got more attentions."

"At the same time, the population growth of people aged over 65 years is also 3.6%, reaching 700,000."

"UV not only tans but also sunburns your skin, so how to enable your skin to go through the military training without sunburn?"
"Sunblock is generally marked with SPF and PA on the package. SPF refers to Sun Protection Function and is targeted at UVB. The common SPF indexes include 15, 30, 50, etc."
"The product marked with PA is more effective against UVA. Generally, the intensity of PA is represented with +. An extra + indicates extension of effective protection time."
People with oily skin should choose water-based sunblock with a strong penetration. Sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
People with dry skin should choose creamy sunscreen. The classification of neutral skin generally has no strict rules. Any kind of skin care products are burden to the sensitive skin. So it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
"Remember to apply sunblock half an hour in advance, because sunscreen products take time to be completely absorbed into the skin."
"Because you are exposed to the sunshine longer during the military training, you have to apply the sunscreen products once every two hours to lengthen the effect and should never be lazy."
"As the skin has just been stimulated by the sun's sake, do not immediately use whitening products after returning from military training."
"After exposure under the blazing sun for quite a long time, please wrap the ice with towel to ease the sunburned skin and alleviate the local heat if condition allowed."

"During some nights, the ionized layer is full of free electrons, which means that the radio signal can go farther."
"The US Air Force was interested in copying this effect, the website of Popular Science, an American monthly magazine, reported on August 11,."
"Although the stable ionizing layer with a large number of free electrons may help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station, this may not appeal to the US Air Force."
"Ionization layer full of electrons indicated the radio used by the military has a larger range of broadcasts. In addition, it may prevent the global positioning system (GPS) signal from the solar storm."
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellite according to the requirement. They may enhance ionization layer when necessary.
"But firstly, the team that signed contract with the air force must prove that the scientific principles will work."
Industry data showed that the total size of coal production in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons and the national coal production overcapacity reached 1.8 billion tons.
"Over the past decade, the State Council has issued a total of five notices for the elimination of excessive and backward production capacity."
"Although the first four notices did not directly target the coal industry, the target industry is directly related to the coal industry."
"From last November to this January, the price of Qinhuangdao 5,500 kcal steam coal lingered at 370 yuan/ton and 90% of the coal enterprises fell into deficits."
"And since February, coal prices have gradually picked up, and Qinhuangdao steam coal prices rose continuously for four weeks, hit a 16-month high and once climbed to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan per ton compared with the beginning of this year."
With the price rising comes concerns of all walks of life: Will a number of small coal mines resume production?
"In this regard, Kuang Xianming, head of the Economic Research Institute of the China (Hainan) Reform and Development Institute, conducted an analysis and interpretation."
"Overcapacity reduction roused high concerns of various parties. The report on the overcapacity reduction by the coal industry announced today worried everyone indeed, according to Kuang Xianming."
"These three superficial factors reflect the reason behind the relative lagging behind of our growth pattern change. That is, the government-led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed."
"Second, it is also directly related to the force of local governments. During the overcapacity reduction process, the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be put into place. From this point of view, the differences are indeed relatively large among different regions."
"Thirdly, some of the provinces that are relatively slow in progress may face greater risks if they seek acceleration in progress in the second half of the year."
"In this case, relying on the central allowance to raise funds to promote the process of capacity reduction may have a negative impact."
"First, overcapacity reduction is not a simple total quantity control."
"Our goal is to eliminate the backward production capacity, promote the optimization of the structure and restructure the new format of the entire coal industry."
"During the process of overcapacity reduction deployment, the local governments must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry to develop the relevant service industry."
"Second, in order to complete this year's overcapacity reduction task within this year, we must give full play to the power of administrative supervision."
"Finally, we should strengthen the protection role of social security."
"Because the market is directly related to the employment issue, we have to strengthen the employment skills training of employees."
"""The reason for the ranking decline is that Brazilian GDP growth is expected to worsen in the medium term."""

The Old Wanfu River and Beidaliu branch channels of the Upgraded Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal Will Charge Tolls Since September 1.
The two tributaries will be transformed via social financing. The charges have been approved by the relevant provincial government departments.
"The old Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang, Yu Tai and then through the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 32.5 km."
"According to the navigation needs, the old Wanfu River channel takes the mode of conservation and transformation. Dredging was conducted on some deep-water segments and some sharp curves were cut so that the navigation conditions can be improved."
"The channel flows through Jinxiang County, Rencheng District and then the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 19 km."
The renovation project of the two waterway started construction in February 2011. The delivery inspection was conducted in January 2015. The investment construction and operation main body is the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center of Jining City.
"In accordance with the principle of ""borrowing for construction and charging for repaying loan"", the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center of Jining City will collect channel tolls according to the charge standard approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau."
"Among them, the basic toll is 1.75 yuan/dwt and mileage toll is 0.05 yuan/km dwt."
"The toll collection period is from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019."
"Reporters learned from the Jining Port and Waterway Bureau that there are a total of 4 toll channels within the Jining region, including Zhushuihe Channel, Baima River Channel, Beidahang Channel and Laowanfu Channel."
"These four channels are branch channels of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which were upgraded and renovated in the way of social financing."
"Zhushuihe Channel Upgrade Renovation Project is the first project adopting the mode of ""government + market"" for the infrastructure construction of river and ports within Shandong Province. The government accounts for the major part of investment while social fund fills the funding gap."
"Baima River, Laowanfu River, Beidaliu River and other feeder routes adopt a pure market operation."
The funds allocated by the national finance cannot meet the needs of the project construction and restrict the progress of the channel upgrade.
Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure are in line with national policy requirements and have become a way to break the bottleneck of funding.
Ning Zetao's performance in the 100 meters freestyle semi-final has made a lot of Chinese audience speechless.
"Ning Zetao once again exceeded people's ""base line"" in the 50-meter freestyle preliminary."
"Actually, this 50-meter freestyle is not the strength of Ning Zetao. His performance and best achievement in Kazan World Championships also indicated that it is not possible for him to make breakthrough in this project."
"Sure enough, Ta Kung Pao, an authoritative media in Hong Kong, revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao to lose is that he has lost interest in swimming."
Many factors may have a great impact on his future ideas. He is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle.
"After Kazan World Championships, Ning Zetao immediately became a celebrity with his good look and excellent performance."
"As a result, ""national husband (a good match)"", ""young fresh meat"", ""Adonis"", etc. became his labels continuously."
A variety of business activities came to him. A good fortune has offered him a golden flashing prospect.
"In this case, that Ning Zetao chooses to withdraw and joins the entertainment circle, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable way."
"After all, he is only 23 years old. After some study, he can star in some TV series with his popularity."
But Ning Zetao needs to see whether he is qualified enough compared with his predecessors.
"At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, the already 21-year-old Liu Xuan came to the end of his athlete career."

"Tian Liang participated in the single and double ten-meter match of two Olympic Games, and won 2 gold and 2 silver."
"But when he was defeated by his counterpart Hu Jia at the 10-meter single match in the 2004 Olympic Games, Tian Liang's competitive state slipped and it was said he was dismissed by the diving team."
"But when he took along his daughter to participate in the variety show ""Dad, Where Are We Going?"" he became a focus."
"The once gold generation including Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing all participated in various forms of variety show."
"It is worth mentioning that, Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng led the Chinese team and won champion in the 2008 Olympic Games men's team. Yang Wei even got his individual all-around gold medal twice and was called as the Almighty King."
And Chen Yibing has become a hoisting ring king while leading his team to win the championship in the 2012 Olympic Games men's team.
"But after he was misjudged and lost the gold in the Rondon Olympic Games, his magnanimous act won him so many funs."
"However, these game players mainly focus on the venue, they just touch and then go at the variety show."
"However, no matter whether they are retired or active athletes, they need to provide outstanding performance to win in the entertainment circle."
"After all, athletes have just stepped into a new area, so it is just a blank state for them in case of capabilities and connection."
"Even for Tian Liang and Liu Xuan, who are not new in the entertainment circle, common people always think of their performance at the Olympic Games when mentioning them."
And the introduction of Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng at the variety show is always Olympic Games Champion.
"Compared with these people, the title of Ning Zetao, a swimming world championship, is not so great."
"Moreover, compared with the withdrawal of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan and Yang Wei, etc. at their peaks, the withdrawal of Ning Zetao at 23 after some setback would cause immeasurable effects to the negative influence of his image."
"After all, at the mention of athletes, they are required to be ""not all-time success but no fear of danger"". Ning Zetao lags far behind from this point."
"At the very least, Ning Zetao can totally rely on his great looks to win the support of thousands of fans."
